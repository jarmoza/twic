What would I give to see his face?
I'd give - I'd give my life - of course -
But that is not enough!
Stop just a minute - let me think!
I'd give my biggest Bobolink!
That makes two - Him - and Life!
You know who "June" is -
I'd give her -
Roses a day from Zinzebar -
And Lily tubes - like wells -
Bees - by the furlong -
Straits of Blue -
Navies of Butterflies - sailed thro' -
And dappled Cowslip Dells -
Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks" -
Daffodil Dowries - spicy "stocks" -
Dominions - broad as Dew -
Bags of Doubloons - adventurous Bees
Brought me - from firmamental seas -
And Purple - from Peru -
Now - have I bought it -
"Shylock"? Say!
Sign me the Bond!
"I vow to pay
To H r - who pledges this -
One hour - of her Sovreign's face"!
Extatic Contract!
Niggard Grace!
My Kingdom's worth of Bliss!
