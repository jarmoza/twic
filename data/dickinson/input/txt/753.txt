The Black Berry - wears a Thorn in his side -
But no Man heard Him cry -
He offers His Berry, just the same
To Partridge - and to Boy -
He sometimes holds opon the Fence -
Or struggles to a Tree -
Or clasps a Rock, with both His Hands -
But not for sympathy -
We - tell a Hurt - to cool it -
This Mourner - to the Sky
A little further reaches - instead -
Brave Black Berry -
