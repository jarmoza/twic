I'm "wife" - I've finished that -
That other state -
I'm Czar - I'm "Woman" now -
It's safer so -
How odd the Girl's life looks
Behind this soft Eclipse -
I think that Earth feels so
To folks in Heaven - now -
This being comfort - then
That other kind - was pain -
But Why compare?
I'm "Wife"! Stop there!
