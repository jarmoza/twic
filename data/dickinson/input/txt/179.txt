Besides the autumn poets sing
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze.
A few incisive mornings -
A few ascetic eves -
Gone - Mr Bryant's "Golden Rod"
And Mr Thom'son's "Sheaves" -
Still, is the bustle in the brook,
Sealed, are the spicy valves.
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The eyes of many Elves -
Perhaps a squirrel may remain
My sentiments to share -
Grant me Oh Lord a sunny mind -
Thy windy will to bear!
