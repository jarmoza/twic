Forever at His side to walk -
The smaller of the two!
Brain of His Brain -
Blood of His Blood -
Two lives - One Being - now -
Forever of His fate to taste -
If grief - the largest part -
If joy - to put my piece away
For that beloved Heart -
All life - to know each other
Whom we can never learn -
And bye and bye - a Change -
Called Heaven -
Rapt neighborhoods of men -
Just finding out - what puzzled us -
Without the lexicon!
