To disappear enhances -
The Man who runs away
Is gilded for an instant
With Immortality
But yesterday a Vagrant
Today in Memory lain
With superstitious  value -
We tamper with again
But Never - far as Honor
Removes the paltry  Thing
And impotent to cherish
We hasten to adorn -
Of Death the  sternest feature
That just as we discern
The Quality defies us -
Securest gathered then
The Fruit perverse to plucking
But leaning to the Sight
With the extatic limit
Of unobtained Delight.
