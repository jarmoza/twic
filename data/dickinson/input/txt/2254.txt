Expanse cannot be lost -
Not Joy, but a Decree
Is Deity -
His Scene, Infinity -
Whose rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Beam was sown,
Not even a Prognostic's push
Could make a Dent thereon -
The World that thou hast opened
Shuts for thee,
But not alone,
We all have followed thee -
Escape more slowly
To thy Tracts of Sheen -
The Tent is listening,
But the Troops are gone!
