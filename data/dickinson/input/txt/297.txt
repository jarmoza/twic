Tho' I get home how late - how late -
So I get home - 'twill compensate -
Better will be the Extasy
That they have done expecting me -
When night - descending - dumb - and dark -
They hear my unexpected knock -
Transporting must the moment be -
Brewed from decades of Agony!
To think just how the fire will burn -
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn -
To wonder what myself will say,
And what itself, will say to me -
Beguiles the Centuries of way!
