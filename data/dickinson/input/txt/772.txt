She hideth Her the last -
And is the first, to rise -
Her Night doth hardly recompense
The Closing of Her eyes -
She doth Her Purple Work -
And putteth Her away
In low apartments in the sod -
As Worthily as We.
To imitate Her life
As impotent would be
As make of Our imperfect Mints,
The Julep - of the Bee -
