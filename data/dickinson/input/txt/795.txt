I went to Heaven -
'Twas a small Town -
Lit - with a Ruby -
Lathed - with Down -
Stiller - than the fields
At the full Dew -
Beautiful - as Pictures -
No Man drew -
People - like the Moth -
Of Mechlin - frames -
Duties - of Gossamer -
And Eider - names -
Almost - contented -
I - could be -
'Mong such unique
Society -
