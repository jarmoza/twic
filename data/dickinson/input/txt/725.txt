My period had come for Prayer -
No other Art - would do -
My Tactics missed a rudiment -
Creator - Was it you?
God grows above - so those who pray
Horizons - must ascend -
And so I stepped opon the North
To  see this Curious Friend -
His House was not - no sign had He -
By Chimney - nor by Door -
Could I infer his Residence -
Vast Prairies of Air
Unbroken by a Settler -
Were all that I could see -
Infinitude - Had'st Thou no Face
That I might look on Thee?
The Silence condescended -
Creation stopped - for me -
But awed beyond my errand -
I worshipped - did not "pray" -
