You cannot make Remembrance grow
When it has lost it's Root -
The tightening the Soil around
And setting it upright
Deceives perhaps the Universe
But not retrieves the Plant -
Real Memory, like Cedar Feet
Is shod with Adamant -
Nor can you cut Remembrance down
When it shall once have grown -
It's Iron Buds will sprout anew
However overthrown -
Disperse it - slay it -
