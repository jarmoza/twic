"Secrets" is a daily word
Yet does not exist -
Muffled - it remits surmise -
Murmured - it has ceased -
Dungeoned in the Human Breast
Doubtless secrets lie -
But that Grate inviolate -
Comes nor goes away
Nothing with a Tongue or Ear -
Secrets stapled there
Will emerge but once - and dumb -
To the Sepulchre -
