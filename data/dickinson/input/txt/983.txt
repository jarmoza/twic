Joy to have merited the Pain -
To merit the Release -
Joy to have perished every step -
To Compass Paradise -
Pardon - to look opon thy face -
With these old fashioned Eyes -
Better than new - could be - for that -
Though bought in Paradise -
Because they looked on thee before -
And thou hast looked on them -
Prove Me - My Hazel Witnesses
The features are the same -
So fleet thou wert, when present -
So infinite - when gone -
An Orient's Apparition -
Remanded of the Morn -
The Hight I recollect -
'Twas even with the Hills -
The Depth opon my Soul was notched -
As Floods - on Whites of Wheels -
To Haunt - till Time have dropped
His last Decade away,
And Haunting actualize - to last
At least - Eternity -
