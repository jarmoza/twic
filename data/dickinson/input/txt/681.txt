When I hoped, I recollect
Just the place I stood -
At a Window facing West -
Roughest Air - was good -
Not a Sleet could bite me -
Not a frost could cool -
Hope it was that kept me warm -
Not Merino shawl -
When I feared - I recollect
Just the Day it was -
Worlds were lying out to Sun -
Yet how Nature froze -
Icicles opon my soul
Prickled Blue and cool -
Bird went praising everywhere -
Only Me - was still -
And the Day that I despaired -
This - if I forget
Nature will - that it be Night
After Sun has set -
Darkness intersect her face -
And put out her eye -
Nature hesitate - before
Memory and I -
