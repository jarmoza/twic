These are the Signs to Nature's Inns -
Her invitation broad
To Whosoever famishing
To taste her mystic Bread -
These are the rites of Nature's House -
The Hospitality
That opens with an equal width
To Beggar and to Bee
For Sureties of her staunch Estate
Her undecaying Cheer
The Purple in the East is set
And in the North, the Star -
