Faith - is the Pierless Bridge
Supporting what We see
Unto the Scene that We do not -
Too slender for the eye
It bears the Soul as bold
As it were rocked in Steel
With Arms of steel at either side -
It joins - behind the Vail
To what, could We presume
The Bridge would cease to be
To Our far, vascillating Feet
A first Nescessity.
