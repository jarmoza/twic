Take Your Heaven further on -
This - to Heaven divine Has gone -
Had You earlier blundered in
Possibly, e'en You had seen
An Eternity - put on -
Now - to ring a Door beyond
Is the utmost of Your Hand -
To the Skies - apologize -
Nearer to Your Courtesies
Than this Sufferer polite -
Dressed to meet You -
See - in White!
