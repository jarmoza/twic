Facts by our side are never sudden
Until they look around
And then they scare us like a spectre
Protruding from the Ground -
The hight of our  portentous Neighbor
We never know -
Till summoned to his recognition
By an Adieu -
Adieu for whence the sage cannot Conjecture
The bravest die
As ignorant of their resumption
As you or I -
