So bashful when I spied her!
So pretty - so ashamed!
So hidden in her leaflets
Lest anybody find -
So breathless till I passed her -
So helpless when I turned
And bore her struggling, blushing,
Her simple haunts beyond!
For whom I robbed the Dingle -
For whom betrayed the Dell -
Many, will doubtless ask me -
But I shall never tell!
