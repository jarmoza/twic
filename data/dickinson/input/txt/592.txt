Your Riches - taught me - Poverty.
Myself - a Millionaire
In little Wealths, as Girls could boast
Till broad as Buenos Ayre -
You drifted your Dominions -
A Different Peru -
And I esteemed all Poverty
For Life's Estate with you -
Of Mines, I little know, myself -
But just the names, of Gems -
The Colors of the Commonest -
And scarce of Diadems -
So much, that did I meet the Queen -
Her Glory I should know -
But this, must be a different Wealth -
To miss it - beggars so -
I'm sure 'tis India - all Day -
To those who look on You -
Without a stint - without a blame,
Might I - but be the Jew -
I'm sure it is Golconda -
Beyond my power to deem -
To have a smile for mine - each Day,
How better, than a Gem!
At least, it solaces to know
That there exists - a Gold -
Altho' I prove it, just in time
It's distance - to behold -
It's far - far Treasure to surmise -
And estimate the Pearl -
That slipped my simple fingers through -
While just a Girl at school.
