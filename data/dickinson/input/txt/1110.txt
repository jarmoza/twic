The first Day that I was a Life
I recollect it - How still -
The last Day that I was a Life
I recollect it - as well -
'Twas stiller - though the first
Was still -
'Twas empty - but the first
Was full -
This - was my finallest Occasion -
But then
My tenderer Experiment
Toward Men -
"Which choose I"?
That - I cannot say -
"Which choose They"?
Question Memory!
