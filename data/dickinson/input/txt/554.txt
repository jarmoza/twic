It would never be Common - more - I said -
Difference - had begun -
Many a bitterness - had been -
But that old sort - was done -
Or - if it sometime - showed - as 'twill -
Opon the Downiest - morn -
Such bliss - had I - for all the years -
'Twould give an easier - pain -
I'd so much joy - I told it - Red -
Opon my simple Cheek -
I felt it publish - in my eye -
'Twas needless - any speak -
I walked - as wings - my body bore -
The feet - I former used -
Unnescessary - now to me -
As boots - would be - to Birds -
I put my pleasure all abroad -
I dealt a word of Gold
To every Creature - that I met -
And Dowered - all the World -
When - suddenly - my Riches shrank -
A Goblin - drank my Dew -
My Palaces - dropped tenantless -
Myself - was beggared - too -
I clutched at sounds -
I groped at shapes -
I touched the tops of Films -
I felt the Wilderness roll back
Along my Golden lines -
The Sackcloth - hangs opon the nail -
The Frock I used to wear -
But where my moment of Brocade -
My - drop - of India?
