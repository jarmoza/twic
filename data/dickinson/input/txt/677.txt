My Faith is larger than the Hills -
So when the Hills decay -
My Faith must take the Purple Wheel
To show the Sun the way -
'Tis first He steps opon the Vane -
And then - opon the Hill -
And then abroad the World He go
To do His Golden Will -
And if His Yellow feet should miss -
The Bird would not arise -
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems -
No Bells have Paradise -
How dare I, therefore, stint a faith
On which so vast depends -
Lest Firmament should fail for me -
The Rivet in the Bands
