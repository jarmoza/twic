Her final Summer was it -
And yet We guessed it not -
If tenderer industriousness
Pervaded Her, We thought
A further force of life
Developed from within -
When Death lit all the   shortness up
It made the hurry plain -
We wondered at our blindness
When nothing was to see
But Her Carrara Guide post -
At Our Stupidity -
When duller than our dullness
The Busy Darling lay -
So busy was she - finishing -
So leisurely - were We -
