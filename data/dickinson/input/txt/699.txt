The birds begun at four o'clock
Their period for dawn
A music numerous as space
And neighboring as noon -
I could not count their force
Their numbers did expend
As brook by brook bestows itself
To multiply the pond
Their listener was not
Except occasional man
In homely industry arrayed
To overtake the
Nor was it for applause
That I could ascertain
But independent extasy
Of universe and men.
By six the flood had done
No tumult there had been
Of dressing, or departure -
Yet all the band was gone.
The sun engrossed the east -
The day resumed the world -
The miracle that introduced -
Forgotten - as fulfilled.
