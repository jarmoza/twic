Did Our Best Moment last -
'Twould supersede the Heaven -
A few - and they by Risk - procure -
So this Sort - are not given -
Except as stimulants - in
Cases of Despair -
Or Stupor - The Reserve -
These Heavenly moments are -
A Grant of the Divine -
That Certain as it Comes -
Withdraws - and leaves the dazzled Soul
In her unfurnished Rooms -
