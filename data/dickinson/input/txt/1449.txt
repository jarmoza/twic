The last Night that She lived
It was a Common Night
Except the Dying - this to Us
Made Nature different
We noticed smallest things -
Things overlooked before
By this great light opon our minds
Italicized - as 'twere.
As We went out and in
Between Her final Room
And Rooms where Those to be alive
Tomorrow, were, a Blame
That others could exist
While She must finish quite
A Jealousy for Her arose
So nearly infinite -
We waited while She passed -
It was a narrow time -
Too jostled were Our Souls to speak
At length the notice came.
She mentioned, and forgot -
Then lightly as a Reed
Bent to the Water,  struggled scarce -
Consented, and was dead -
And We - We placed the Hair -
And drew the Head erect -
And then an awful leisure was
Belief to regulate -
