The Heaven vests for Each
In that small Deity
It craved the grace to worship
Some bashful Summer's Day -
Half shrinking from the Glory
It importuned to see
Till these faint Tabernacles drop
In full Eternity -
How imminent the Venture -
As One should sue a Star -
For His mean sake to leave the Row
And entertain Despair -
A Clemency so common -
We almost cease to fear -
Enabling the minutest -
And furthest - to adore -
