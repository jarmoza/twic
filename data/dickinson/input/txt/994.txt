It's easy to invent a Life -
God does it - every Day -
Creation - but the Gambol
Of His Authority -
It's easy to efface it -
The thrifty Deity
Could scarce afford Eternity
To Spontaneity -
The Perished Patterns murmur -
But His Perturbless Plan
Proceed - inserting Here - a Sun -
There - leaving out a Man -
