Three times - we parted - Breath - and I -
Three times - He would not go -
But strove to stir the lifeless Fan
The Waters - strove to stay.
Three times - the Billows threw me up -
Then caught me - like a Ball -
Then made Blue faces in my face -
And pushed away a sail
That crawled Leagues off - I liked to see -
For thinking - While I die -
How pleasant to behold a Thing
Where Human faces - be -
The Waves grew sleepy - Breath - did not -
The Winds - like Children - lulled -
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis -
And I stood up - and lived -
