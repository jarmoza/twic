When we stand on the tops of Things -
And like the Trees, look down,
The smoke all cleared away from it -
And mirrorrs on the scene -
Just laying light - no soul will wink
Except it have the flaw -
The Sound ones, like the Hills - shall stand -
No lightning, scares away -
The Perfect, nowhere be afraid -
They bear their dauntless Heads,
Where others, dare not  go at noon,
Protected by their deeds -
The Stars dare shine occasionally
Opon a spotted World -
And Suns, go surer, for their Proof,
As if an axle, held -
