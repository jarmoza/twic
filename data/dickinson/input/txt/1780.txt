My Heart ran so to thee
It would not wait for me
And I affronted grew
And drew away
For whatsoe'er my pace
He first achieve thy Face -
How general a Grace
Allotted two -
Not in malignity
Mentioned I this to thee -
Had he obliquity
Soonest to share
But for the Greed of him -
Boasting my Premium -
Basking in Bethleem
Ere I be there -
