Glee - The great storm is over -
Four - have recovered the Land -
Forty - gone down together -
Into the boiling Sand -
Ring - for the scant Salvation -
Toll - for the bonnie Souls -
Neighbor - and friend - and Bridegroom -
Spinning opon the Shoals -
How they will tell the story -
When Winter shake the Door -
Till the Children urge -
But the Forty -
Did they - Come back no more?
Then a silence - suffuse the story -
And a softness - the Teller's eye -
And the Children - no further question -
And only the Sea - reply -
