I dreaded that first Robin, so,
But He is mastered, now,
I'm some accustomed to Him grown,
He hurts a little, though -
I thought if I could only live
Till that first Shout got by -
Not all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle me -
I dared not meet the Daffodils -
For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own -
I wished the Grass would hurry -
So when 'twas time to see -
He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me -
I could not bear the Bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go,
What word had they, for me?
They're here, though; not a creature failed -
No Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me -
The Queen of Calvary -
Each one salutes me, as he goes,
And I, my childish Plumes,
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgement
Of their unthinking Drums -
