No Other can reduce Our
Mortal Consequence
Like the remembering it be Nought -
A Period from hence -
But Contemplation for
Cotemporaneous Nought
Our Mutual Fame - that haply
Jehovah - recollect -
No Other can exalt Our
Mortal Consequence
Like the remembering it exist -
A period from hence -
Invited from Itself
To the Creator's House -
To tarry an Eternity -
His - shortest Consciousness -
