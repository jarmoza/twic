Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?
Not Death - for who is He?
The Porter of my Father's Lodge
As much abasheth me!
Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear a  thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or two existences -
Just as the case may be -
Of Resurrection? Is the East
Afraid to trust the Morn
With her fastidious forehead?
As soon impeach my Crown!
