The Winters are so short -
I'm hardly justified
In sending all the Birds away -
And moving into Pod -
Myself - for scarcely settled -
The Phebes have begun -
And then - it's time to strike my Tent -
And open House - again -
It's mostly, interruptions -
My Summer - is despoiled -
Because there was a Winter - once -
And all the Cattle - starved -
And so there was a Deluge -
And swept the World away -
But Ararat's a Legend - now -
And no one credits Noah -
