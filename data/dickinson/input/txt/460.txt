If I'm lost - now -
That I was found -
Shall still my transport be -
That once - on me - those Jasper Gates
Blazed open - suddenly -
That in my awkward - gazing - face -
The Angels - softly peered -
And touched me with their fleeces,
Almost as if they cared -
I'm banished - now - you know it -
How foreign that can be -
You'll know - Sir - when the Savior's face
Turns so - away from you -
