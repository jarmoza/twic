Grief is a Mouse -
And chooses Wainscot in the Breast
For His shy House -
And baffles quest -
Grief is a Thief - quick startled -
Pricks His Ear - report to hear
Of that Vast Dark -
That swept His Being - back -
Grief is a Juggler - boldest at the Play -
Lest if He flinch - the eye that way
Pounce on His Bruises - One - say - or Three -
Grief is a Gourmand - spare His luxury -
Best Grief is Tongueless - before He'll tell -
Burn Him in the Public square -
His Ashes - will
Possibly - if they refuse - How then know -
Since a Rack could'nt coax  a syllable - now
