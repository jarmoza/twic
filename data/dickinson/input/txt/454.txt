I know some lonely Houses off the Road
A Robber'd like the look of -
Wooden barred,
And Windows hanging low,
Inviting to -
A Portico,
Where two could creep -
One - hand the Tools -
The other peep -
To make sure all's asleep -
Old fashioned eyes -
Not easy to surprise!
How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night -
With just a Clock -
But they could gag the Tick -
And Mice ont bark -
And so the Walls - dont tell -
None - will -
A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir -
An Almanac's aware -
Was it the Mat - winked,
Or a nervous Star?
The Moon - slides down the stair -
To see who's there!
There's plunder - where -
Tankard, or Spoon -
Earring - or Stone -
A Watch - Some Ancient Brooch
To match the Grandmama -
Staid sleeping - there -
Day - rattles - too -
Stealth's - slow -
The Sun has got as far
As the third Sycamore -
Screams Chanticleer
"Who's there"?
And Echoes - Trains away,
Sneer - "Where"!
While the old Couple, just astir,
Fancy the Sunrise - left the door ajar!
