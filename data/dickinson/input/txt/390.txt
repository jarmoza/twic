Rearrange a "Wife's" Affection!
When they dislocate my Brain!
Amputate my freckled Bosom!
Make me bearded like a man!
Blush, my spirit, in thy Fastness -
Blush, my unacknowledged clay -
Seven years of troth have taught thee
More than Wifehood ever may!
Love that never leaped it's socket -
Trust intrenched in narrow pain -
Constancy thro' fire - awarded -
Anguish - bare of anodyne!
Burden - borne so far triumphant -
None suspect me of the crown,
For I wear the "Thorns" till Sunset -
Then - my Diadem put on.
Big my Secret but it's  bandaged -
It will never get away
Till the Day it's Weary Keeper
Leads it through the Grave to thee.
