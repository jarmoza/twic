Superfluous were the Sun
When Excellence be dead
He were superfluous every Day
For every Day be said
That syllable whose Faith
Just saves it from Despair
And whose "I'll meet You" hesitates
If Love inquire "Where"?
Opon His dateless Fame
Our Periods may lie
As Stars that drop anonymous
From an abundant sky.
