Whatever it is - she has tried it -
Awful Father of Love -
Is not Our's the chastising -
Do not chastise the Dove -
Not for Ourselves, petition -
Nothing is left to pray -
When a subject is finished -
Words are handed away -
Only lest she be lonely
In thy beautiful House
Give her for her Transgression
License to think of us -
