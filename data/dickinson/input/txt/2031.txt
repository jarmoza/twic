Before you thought of Spring
Except as a Surmise
You see - God bless his Suddenness -
A Fellow in the Skies
Of independent Hues
A little weather worn
Inspiriting habiliments
Of Indigo and Brown -
With specimens of song
As if for you to choose -
Discretion in the interval -
With gay delays he goes
To some superior Tree
Without a single Leaf
And shouts for joy to nobody
But his seraphic Self -
