You know that Portrait in the Moon -
So tell me Who 'tis like -
The very Brow - the stooping eyes -
A'fog for - Say - Whose Sake?
The very Pattern of the Cheek -
It varies - in the Chin -
But - Ishmael - since we met - 'tis long -
And fashions - intervene -
When Moon's at full - 'Tis Thou - I say -
My lips just hold the name -
When crescent - Thou art worn - I note -
But - there - the Golden Same -
And when - Some Night - Bold - slashing Clouds
Cut Thee away from Me -
That's easier - than the other film
That glazes Holiday -
