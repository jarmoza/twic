He showed me Hights I never saw -
"Would'st Climb" - He said?
I said, "Not so" -
"With me -" He said - "With me"?
He showed me secrets - Morning's Nest -
The Rope the Nights were put across -
"And now, Would'st have me for a Guest"?
I could not find my "Yes" -
And then - He brake His Life - And lo,
A light for me, did solemn glow -
The steadier, as my face withdrew -
And could I further "No"?
