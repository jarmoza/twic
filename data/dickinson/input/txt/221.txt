A little East of Jordan,
Evangelists record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard -
Till morning touching mountain -
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast - to return!
Not so, said cunning Jacob!
"I will not let thee go
Except though bless me" - Stranger!
The which acceded to -
Light swung the silver fleeces
"Peniel" Hills beyond,
And the bewildered Gymnast
Found he had worsted God!
