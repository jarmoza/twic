The Spider holds a Silver Ball
In unperceived Hands -
And dancing softly to Himself
His Yarn of Pearl - unwinds -
He plies from nought to nought -
In unsubstantial Trade -
Supplants our Tapestries with His -
In half the period -
An Hour to rear supreme
His Continents of Light -
Then dangle from the Housewife's Broom -
His Boundaries - forgot -
