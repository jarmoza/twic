I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not Frankfort berries yield the sense
Such a delirious whirl.
Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew;--
Reeling through endless summer days,
From inns of molten blue.
When landlords turn the drunken bee
Out of the Foxglove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
I shall but drink the more;
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
And saints to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Come staggering toward the sun.
