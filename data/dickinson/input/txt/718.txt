When I was small, a Woman died -
Today - her Only Boy
Went up from the Potomac -
His face all Victory
To look at her - How slowly
The Seasons must have turned
Till Bullets clipt an Angle
And He passed quickly round -
If pride shall be in Paradise -
Ourself cannot decide -
Of their imperial conduct -
No person testified -
But, proud in Apparition -
That Woman and her Boy
Pass back and forth, before my Brain
As even in the sky -
I'm confident, that Bravoes -
Perpetual break abroad
For Braveries, remote as this
In Yonder Maryland -
