Make me a picture of the sun -
So I can hang it in my room.
And make believe I'm getting warm
When others call it "Day"!
Draw me a Robin - on a stem -
So I am hearing him, I'll dream,
And when the Orchards stop their tune -
Put my pretense - away -
Say if it's really - warm at noon -
Whether it's Buttercups - that "skim" -
Or Butterflies - that "bloom"?
Then - skip - the frost - opon the lea -
And skip the Russet - on the tree -
Let's play those - never come!
