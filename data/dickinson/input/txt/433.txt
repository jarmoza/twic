I got so I could hear his name -
Without - Tremendous gain -
That Stop-sensation - on my Soul -
And Thunder - in the Room -
I got so I could walk across
That Angle in the floor,
Where he turned so, and I  turned - how -
And all our Sinew tore -
I got so I could stir the Box -
In which his letters grew
Without that forcing, in my breath -
As Staples - driven through -
Could dimly recollect a Grace -
I think, they called it "God" -
Renowned to ease Extremity -
When Formula, had failed -
And shape my Hands -
Petition's way,
Tho' ignorant of a word
That Ordination - utters -
My Business - with the Cloud,
If any Power behind it, be,
Not subject to Despair -
It care - in some remoter way,
For so minute affair
As Misery -
Itself, too great, for interrupting - more -
