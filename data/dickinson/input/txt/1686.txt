I thought that nature was enough
Till Human nature came
And that the other did absorb
As Parallax a Flame -
Of Human nature just aware
There added the Divine
Brief struggle for capacity
The power to contain
Is always as the contents
But give a Giant room
And you will lodge a Giant
And not a  smaller man
