The Manner of it's Death
When Certain it must die -
'Tis deemed a privilege to choose -
'Twas Major Andre's Way -
When Choice of Life - is past -
There yet remains a Love
It's little Fate to stipulate -
How small in those who live -
The Miracle to teaze
With Babble of the styles -
How "they are dying mostly - now" -
And Customs at "St James"!
