There is a flower that Bees prefer -
And Butterflies - desire -
To gain the Purple Democrat
The Humming Bird - aspire -
And Whatsoever Insect pass -
A Honey bear away
Proportioned to his several dearth
And her - capacity -
Her face be rounder than the Moon
And ruddier than the Gown
Of Orchis in the Pasture -
Or Rhododendron - worn -
She doth not wait for June -
Before the World be Green -
Her sturdy little Countenance
Against the Wind - be seen -
Contending with the Grass -
Near Kinsman to Herself -
For privilege of Sod and Sun -
Sweet Litigants for Life -
And when the Hills be full -
And newer fashions blow -
Doth not retract a single spice
For pang of jealousy -
Her Public - be the Noon -
Her Providence - the Sun -
Her Progress - by the Bee - proclaimed -
In sovreign - Swerveless Tune -
The Bravest - of the Host -
Surrendering - the last -
Nor even of Defeat - aware -
When cancelled by the Frost -
