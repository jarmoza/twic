The only Ghost I ever saw
Was dressed in Mechlin - so -
He had no sandal on his foot -
And stepped like flakes of snow -
His Mien, was soundless, like  the Bird -
But rapid - like the Roe -
His fashions, quaint, Mosaic -
Or haply, Mistletoe -
His conversation - seldom -
His laughter, like the Breeze
That dies away in Dimples
Among the pensive Trees -
Our interview - was transient -
Of me, himself was shy -
And God forbid I look behind -
Since that appalling Day!
