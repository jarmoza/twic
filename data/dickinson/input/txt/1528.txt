The duties of the Wind are few -
To cast the ships, at Sea,
Establish March, the Floods escort,
And usher Liberty.
The pleasures of the Wind are broad,
To dwell Extent among,
Remain, or wander,
Speculate, or Forests entertain -
The kinsmen of the Wind, are Peaks
Azof - the Equinox,
Also with Bird and Asteroid
A bowing intercourse -
The limitations of the Wind
Do he exist, or die,
Too wise he seems for Wakelessness,
However, know not I -
