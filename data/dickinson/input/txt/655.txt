'Tis good - the looking back on Grief -
To re-endure a Day -
We thought the mighty Funeral -
Of all conceived Joy -
To recollect how Busy Grass
Did meddle - one by one -
Till all the Grief with Summer -  waved
And none could see the stone.
And though the Wo you have Today
Be larger - As the Sea
Exceeds it's unremembered Drop -
They're Water - equally -
