The Wind did'nt come from the Orchard - today!
Farther than that!
Nor stop to play with the Hay -
Nor ogle a Hat
He's a transitive fellow - very -
Rely on that!
When he leave a Burr at the door -
We say he has Climbed a Fir!
But - the Fir is where?
Declare! Were you ever  there?
If he bring Odors of Clovers -
And that is his business - not our's -
Then he has been with the Mowers -
Whetting away the Hours
To sweet pauses of Hay -
A way he has
Of a June day!
If he fling Dust - and pebble -
Little Boy's Hats - and stubble -
With an occasional steeple -
And a hoarse 'Get out of the way - I say' -
Who'd be the fool to stay?
Would you!  Say! Would you be the fool - to stay?
