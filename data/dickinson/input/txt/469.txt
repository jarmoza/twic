Good Night! Which put the Candle out?
A jealous Zephyr - not a doubt -
Ah, friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The Angels - labored diligent -
Extinguished - now - for you!
It might - have been the Light House spark -
Some Sailor - rowing in the Dark -
Had importuned to see!
It might - have been the Waning lamp
That lit the Drummer from the Camp
To purer Reveille!
