To disappear enhances - The Man that runs away
Is tinctured for an instant with Immortality
But yesterday a Vagrant -
Today, in Memory lain
With superstitious value -
We tamper with "Again"
But "Never" far as Honor
Withdraws the worthless thing
And impotent to cherish
We hasten to adorn.
Of Death the sternest function
That just as we discern
The Excellence defies us -
Securest gathered then
The Fruit perverse to plucking, but leaning to the Sight
With the extatic limit
Of unobtained Delight -
