Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews,
But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited their - low Brows -
Or Bees - that thought the Summer's name
Some rumor of Delirium,
No Summer - could - for Them -
Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred -
By Tropic Hint - some Travelled Bird
Imported to the Wood -
Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear -
Making that homely, and severe,
Contented, known, before -
The Heaven - unexpected come,
To Lives that thought the Worshipping
A too presumptuous Psalm -
