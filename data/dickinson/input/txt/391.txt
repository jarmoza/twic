Why - do they shut me out of Heaven?
Did I sing - too loud?
But - I can say a little "minor"
Timid as a Bird!
Would'nt the Angels try me -
Just - once - more -
Just - see - if I troubled them -
But dont - shut the door!
Oh, if I - were the Gentleman
In the "White Robe" -
And they - were the little Hand - that knocked -
Could - I - forbid?
