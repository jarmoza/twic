I met a King this Afternoon!
He had not on a Crown indeed -
A little Palm leaf Hat was all,
And he was barefoot, I'm afraid!
But sure I am he Ermine wore
Beneath his faded Jacket's blue -
And sure I am, the crest he bore
Within that Jacket's pocket too!
For 'twas too stately for an Earl -
A Marquis would not go so grand!
'Twas possibly a Czar petite -
A Pope, or something of that kind!
If I must tell you, of a Horse
My freckled Monarch held the rein -
Doubtless, an estimable Beast,
But not at all disposed to run!
And such a wagon! While I live
Dare I presume to see
Another such a vehicle
As then transported me!
Two other ragged Princes
His royal state partook!
Doubtless the first excursion
These sovreigns ever took!
I question if the Royal Coach
Round which the Footmen wait
Has the significance, on high,
Of this Barefoot Estate!
