One Sister have I in our house -
And one, a hedge away.
There's only one recorded,
But both belong to me.
One came the road that I came -
And wore my last year's gown -
The other, as a bird her nest,
Builded our hearts among.
She did not sing as we did -
It was a different tune -
Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.
Today is far from Childhood -
But up and down the hills
I held her hand the tighter -
Which shortened all the miles -
And still her hum
The years among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
Still in her Eye
The Violets lie
Mouldered this many May.
I spilt the dew -
But took the morn;
I chose this single star
From out the wide night's numbers -
Sue - forevermore!
