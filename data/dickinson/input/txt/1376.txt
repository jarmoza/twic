Bloom - is Result - to meet a Flower
And casually glance
Would cause one scarcely to suspect
The minor Circumstance
Assisting in the Bright Affair
So intricately done
Then offered as a Butterfly
To the Meridian -
To pack the Bud - oppose the Worm -
Obtain it's right of Dew -
Adjust the Heat - elude the Wind -
Escape the prowling Bee -
Great Nature not to disappoint
Awaiting Her that Day -
To be a Flower, is profound
Responsibility -
