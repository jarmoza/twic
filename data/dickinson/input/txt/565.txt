The Morning after Wo -
'Tis frequently the Way -
Surpasses all that rose before -
For utter Jubilee -
As Nature did not Care -
And piled her Blossoms on -
The further to parade a Joy
Her Victim stared opon -
The Birds declaim their Tunes -
Pronouncing every word
Like Hammers - Did they know they fell
Like Litanies of Lead -
On here and there - a creature -
They'd modify the Glee
To fit some Crucifixal Clef -
Some key of Calvary -
