I think the Hemlock likes to stand
Opon a Marge of Snow -
It suits his own Austerity -
And satisfies an awe
That men, must slake in Wilderness -
And in the Desert - cloy -
An instinct for the Hoar, the Bald -
Lapland's - nescessity -
The Hemlock's nature thrives - on cold -
The Gnash of Northern winds
Is sweetest nutriment - to him -
His best Norwegian Wines -
To satin Races - he is nought -
But children on the Don,
Beneath his Tabernacles, play,
And Dnieper Wrestlers, run.
