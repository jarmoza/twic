I envy Seas, whereon He rides -
I envy Spokes of Wheels
Of Chariots, that Him convey -
I envy Crooked Hills
That gaze opon His journey -
How easy all can see
What is forbidden utterly
As Heaven - unto me!
I envy Nests of Sparrows -
That dot His distant Eaves;
The wealthy Fly, opon His Pane -
The happy - happy Leaves -
That just abroad His Window
Have Summer's leave to play -
The Ear Rings of Pizarro
Could not obtain for me -
I envy Light - that wakes Him -
And Bells - that boldly ring
To tell Him it is Noon, abroad -
Myself - be Noon to Him -
Yet interdict - my Blossom -
And abrogate - my Bee -
Lest Noon in everlasting night -
Drop Gabriel - and me -
