'Tis One by One - the Father counts -
And then a Tract between
Set Cypherless - to teach the Eye
The Value of it's Ten -
Until the peevish Student
Acquire the Quick of Skill -
Then Numerals are dowered back -
Adorning all the Rule -
'Tis mostly Slate and Pencil -
And Darkness on the School
Distracts the Children's fingers -
Still the Eternal Rule
Regards least Cypherer alike
With Leader of the Band -
And every separate Urchin's Sum -
Is fashioned for his hand -
