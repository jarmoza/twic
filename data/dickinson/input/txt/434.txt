A single Screw of Flesh
Is all that pins the Soul
That stands for Deity, to mine,
Opon my side the Vail -
Once witnessed of the Gauze -
It's name is put away
As far from mine, as if no plight
Had printed yesterday,
In tender - solemn Alphabet,
My eyes just turned to see -
When it was smuggled by my sight
Into Eternity -
More Hands - to hold - These are but Two -
One more new-mailed Nerve
Just granted, for the Peril's sake -
Some striding - Giant - Love -
So greater than the Gods can show,
They slink before the Clay,
That not for all their Heaven can boast
Will let it's Keepsake - go
