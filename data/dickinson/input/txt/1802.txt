Not with a Club, the Heart is broken
Nor with a Stone -
A Whip so small you could not see it
I've known
To lash the Magic Creature
Till it fell,
Yet that Whip's Name
Too noble then to tell.
Magnanimous as Bird
By Boy descried -
Singing unto the Stone
Of which it died -
Shame need not crouch
In such an Earth as Our's -
Shame - stand erect -
The Universe is your's.
