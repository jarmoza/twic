When they come back - if Blossoms do -
I always feel a doubt
If Blossoms can be born again
When once the Art is out -
When they begin, if Robins may,
I always had a fear
I did not tell, it was their last Experiment
Last Year,
When it is May, if May return,
Had nobody a pang
Lest in a Face so beautiful
He might not look again?
If I am there - One does not know
What Party - One may be
Tomorrow, but if I am there
I take back all I say -
