I heard, as if I had no Ear
Until a Vital Word
Came all the way from Life to me
And then I knew I heard -
I saw, as if my Eye were on
Another, till a Thing
And now I know 'twas Light, because
It fitted them, came in.
I dwelt, as if Myself were out,
My Body but within
Until a Might detected me
And set my Kernel in -
And Spirit turned unto the Dust
"Old Friend, thou knowest Me",
And Time went out to tell the News
And met Eternity
