I've none to tell me to but Thee
So when Thou failest, nobody -
It was a little tie -
It just held Two, nor those it held
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled
Beyond my Boundary -
If things were opposite - and Me
And Me it were, that ebbed from Thee
On some unanswering Shore -
Would'st Thou seek so - just say
That I the Answer may pursue
Unto the lips it eddied through -
So - overtaking Thee -
