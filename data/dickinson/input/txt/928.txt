Forever - is composed of Nows -
'Tis not a different time -
Except for Infiniteness -
And Latitude of Home -
From this - experienced Here -
Remove the Dates - to These -
Let Months dissolve in further Months -
And Years - exhale in Years -
Without Debate - or Pause -
Or Celebrated Days -
No different Our Years would be
From Anno Dominies -
