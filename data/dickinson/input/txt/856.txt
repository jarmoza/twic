Forget! The lady with the Amulet
Forgot she wore it at her Heart
Because she breathed against
Was Treason twixt?
Deny! Did Rose her Bee -
For Privilege of Play
Or Wile of Butterfly
Or Opportunity - Her Lord away?
The lady with the Amulet - will fade -
The Bee - in Mausoleum laid -
Discard his Bride -
But longer than the little Rill -
That cooled the Forehead of the Hill -
While Other - went the Sea to fill -
And Other - went to turn the Mill -
I'll do thy Will -
