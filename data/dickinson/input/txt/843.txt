The Day that I was crowned
Was like the other Days -
Until the Coronation came -
And then - 'twas Otherwise -
As Carbon in the Coal
And Carbon in the Gem
Are One - and yet the former
Were dull for Diadem -
I rose, and all was plain -
But when the Day declined
Myself and It, in Majesty
Were equally - adorned -
The Grace that I - was chose -
To me - surpassed the Crown
That was the Witness for the Grace -
'Twas even that 'twas Mine -
