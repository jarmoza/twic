No matter - now - Sweet -
But when I'm Earl -
Wont you wish you'd spoken
To that dull Girl?
Trivial a Word - just -
Trivial - a Smile -
But wont you wish you'd spared one
When I'm Earl?
I shant need it - then -
Crests - will do -
Eagles on my Buckles -
On my Belt - too -
Ermine - my familiar Gown -
Say - Sweet - then
Wont you wish you'd smiled - just -
Me opon?
