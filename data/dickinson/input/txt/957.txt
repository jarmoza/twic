If He were living - dare I ask -
And how if He be dead -
And so around the Words I went -
Of meeting them - afraid -
I hinted Changes - Lapse of Time -
The Surfaces of Years -
I touched with Caution - lest they crack -
And show me to my fears -
Reverted to adjoining Lives -
Adroitly turning out
Wherever I suspected Graves -
'Twas prudenter - I thought -
And He - I pushed - with sudden force -
In face of the Suspense -
"Was buried" - "Buried"! "He!"
My Life just holds the Trench -
