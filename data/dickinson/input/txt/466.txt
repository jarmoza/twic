Blazing in Gold - and
Quenching - in Purple!
Leaping - like Leopards the sky -
Then - at the feet of the old Horizon -
Laying it's spotted face - to die!
Stooping as low as the kitchen window -
Touching the Roof -
And tinting the Barn -
Kissing it's Bonnet to the Meadow -
And the Juggler of Day - is gone!
