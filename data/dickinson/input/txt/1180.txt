The Truth - is stirless -
Other force - may be presumed to move -
This - then - is best for confidence -
When oldest Cedars swerve -
And Oaks untwist their fists -
And Mountains - feeble - lean -
How excellent a Body, that
Stands without a Bone -
How vigorous a Force
That holds without a Prop -
Truth stays Herself - and every man
That trusts Her - boldly up -
