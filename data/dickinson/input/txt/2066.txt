Their Barricade against the Sky
The martial Trees withdraw
And with a Flag at every turn
Their Armies are no more -
What Russet Halts in Nature's March
They indicate or cause
An inference of Mexico
Effaces the Surmise -
Recurrent to the After Mind
That Massacre of Air -
The Wound that was not Wound nor Scar -
But Holidays of War -
