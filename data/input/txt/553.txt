The Moon is distant from the Sea -
And yet, with Amber Hands -
She leads Him - docile as a Boy -
Along appointed Sands -
He never misses a Degree -
Obedient to Her eye -
He comes just so far - toward the Town -
Just so far - goes away -
Oh, Signor, Thine, the Amber Hand -
And mine - the distant Sea -
Obedient to the least command
Thine eye impose on me -
