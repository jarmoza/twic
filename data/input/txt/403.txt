Going to Him! Happy letter!
Tell Him -
Tell Him the page I did'nt write -
Tell Him - I only said the Syntax -
And left the Verb and the pronoun - out -
Tell Him just how the fingers hurried -
Then - how they waded - slow - slow -
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages -
So you could see what moved them so -
Tell Him - it was'nt a Practised Writer -
You guessed - from the way the sentence toiled -
You could hear the Boddice tug, behind you -
As if it held but the might of a child -
You almost pitied it - you - it worked so -
Tell Him - No - you may quibble there -
For it would split His Heart, to know it -
And then you and I, were silenter.
Tell Him - Night finished - before we finished -
And the Old Clock kept neighing "Day"!
And you - got sleepy -
And begged to be ended -
What would it hinder so - to - say?
Tell Him - just how she sealed you - Cautious!
But - if He ask where you are hid
Until tomorrow - Happy letter!
Gesture Coquette - and shake your Head!
