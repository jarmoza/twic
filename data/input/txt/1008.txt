Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
Came the Darker Way -
Carriages - Be Sure - and Guests - True -
But for Holiday
'Twas more pitiful Endeavor
Than did Loaded Sea
O'er the Curls attempt to caper
It had cast away -
Never Bride had such Assembling -
Never kinsmen kneeled
To salute so fair a Forehead -
Garland be indeed -
Fitter Feet - of Her before us -
Than whatever Brow
Art of Snow - or Trick of Lily
Possibly bestow
Of Her Father - Whoso  ask Her -
He shall seek as high
As the Palm - that serve the Desert -
To obtain the sky -
Distance - be Her only  Motion -
If 'tis Nay - or Yes -
Acquiescence - or Demurral -
Whosoever guess -
He - must pass the Crystal Angle
That obscure Her face -
He - must have achieved in person
Equal Paradise -
