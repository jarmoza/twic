Through the strait pass of suffering --
The Martyrs -- even -- trod.
Their feet -- upon Temptation --
Their faces -- upon God --
A stately -- shriven -- Company --
Convulsion -- playing round --
Harmless -- as streaks of Meteor --
Upon a Planet's Bond --
Their faith -- the everlasting troth --
Their Expectation -- fair --
The Needle -- to the North Degree --
Wades -- so thro' polar Air!
