This was a Poet -- It is That
Distills amazing sense
From ordinary Meanings --
And Attar so immense
From the familiar species
That perished by the Door --
We wonder it was not Ourselves
Arrested it -- before --
Of Pictures, the Discloser --
The Poet -- it is He --
Entitles Us -- by Contrast --
To ceaseless Poverty --
Of Portion -- so unconscious --
The Robbing -- could not harm --
Himself -- to Him -- a Fortune --
Exterior -- to Time --
