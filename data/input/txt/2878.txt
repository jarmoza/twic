Not in this World to see his face --
Sounds long -- until I read the place
Where this -- is said to be
But just the Primer -- to a life --
Unopened -- rare -- Upon the Shelf --
Clasped yet -- to Him -- and me --
And yet -- My Primer suits me so
I would not choose -- a Book to know
Than that -- be sweeter wise --
Might some one else -- so learned -- be --
And leave me -- just my A -- B -- C --
Himself -- could have the Skies --
