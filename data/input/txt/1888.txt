I suppose the time will come
Aid it in the coming
When the Bird will crowd the Tree
And the Bee be booming -
I suppose the time will come
Hinder it a little
When the Corn in Silk will dress
And in the Apple
I believe the Day will be
When the Jay will giggle
At his new white House the Earth
That, too, halt a little -
