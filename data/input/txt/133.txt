Pigmy seraphs - gone astray -
Velvet people from Vevay -
Belles from some lost summer day -
Bees exclusive Coterie -
Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with emerald -
Venice could not show a cheek
Of a tint so lustrous meek -
Never such an ambuscade
As of briar and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid -
I had rather wear her grace
Than an Earl's distinguished face -
I had rather dwell like her
Than be "Duke of Exeter" -
Royalty enough for me
To subdue the Bumblebee.
