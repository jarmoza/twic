We do not play on Graves -
Because there is'nt Room -
Besides - it is'nt even - it slants
And People come -
And put a Flower on it -
And hang their faces so -
We're fearing that their Hearts will drop -
And crush our pretty play -
And so we move as far
As Enemies - away -
Just looking round to see how far
It is - Occasionally -
