What care the Dead, for Chanticleer -
What care the Dead for Day?
'Tis late your Sunrise vex their face -
And Purple Ribaldry - of Morning
Pour as blank on them
As on the Tier of Wall
The Mason builded, yesterday,
And equally as cool -
What care the Dead for Summer?
The Solstice had no Sun
Could waste the Snow before their Gate -
And knew One Bird a Tune -
Could thrill their Mortised Ear
Of all the Birds that be -
This One - beloved of
Henceforward cherished be -
What care the Dead for Winter?
Themselves as easy freeze -
June Noon - as January Night -
As soon the South - her Breeze
Of Sycamore - or Cinnamon -
Deposit in a Stone
And put a Stone to keep it Warm -
Give Spices - unto Men -
