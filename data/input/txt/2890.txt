It would never be Common -- more -- I said --
Difference -- had begun --
Many a bitterness -- had been --
But that old sort -- was done --
Or -- if it sometime -- showed -- as 'twill --
Upon the Downiest -- Morn --
Such bliss -- had I -- for all the years --
'Twould give an Easier -- pain --
I'd so much joy -- I told it -- Red --
Upon my simple Cheek --
I felt it publish -- in my Eye --
'Twas needless -- any speak --
I walked -- as wings -- my body bore --
The feet -- I former used --
Unnescessary -- now to me --
As boots -- would be -- to Birds --
I put my pleasure all abroad --
I dealt a word of Gold
To every Creature -- that I met --
And Dowered -- all the World --
When -- suddenly -- my Riches shrank --
A Goblin -- drank my Dew --
My Palaces -- dropped tenantless --
Myself -- was beggared -- too --
I clutched at sounds --
I groped at shapes --
I touched the tops of Films --
I felt the Wilderness roll back
Along my Golden lines --
The Sackcloth -- hangs upon the nail --
The Frock I used to wear --
But where my moment of Brocade --
My -- drop -- of India?
