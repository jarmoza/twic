There's something quieter than sleep
Within this inner room!
It wears a sprig opon it's breast -
And will not tell it's name.
Some touch it, and some kiss it -
Some chafe it's idle hand -
It has a simple gravity
I do not understand!
I would not weep, if I were they -
How rude in one to sob!
Might scare the quiet fairy
Back to her native wood!
While simple-hearted neighbors
Chat of the "Early dead" -
We - prone to periphrasis,
Remark that Birds have fled!
