Just lost, when I was saved!
Just heard the world go by!
Just girt me for the onset with eternity
When breath blew back -
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide.
Therefore, as one , I feel,
Odd secrets of "the Line" to tell!
Some sailor skirting novel shores!
Some pale "Reporter" from the awful doors
Before the Seal!
Next time to stay!
Next time, the things to see
By ear unheard -
Unscrutinized by eye!
Next time to tarry
While the Ages steal -
Tramp the slow Centuries
And the Cycles wheel!
