You said that I "was Great" -- one Day --
Then "Great" it be -- if that please Thee --
Or Small -- or any size at all --
Nay -- I'm the size suit Thee --
Tall -- like the Stag -- would that?
Or lower -- like the Wren --
Or other hights of Other Ones
I've seen?
Tell which -- it's dull to guess --
And I must be Rhinoceros
Or Mouse
At once -- for Thee --
So say -- if Queen it be --
Or Page -- please Thee --
I'm that -- or nought --
Or other thing -- if other thing there be --
With just this Stipulus --
I suit Thee --
