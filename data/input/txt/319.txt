On this long storm the Rainbow rose -
On this late morn - the sun -
The Clouds - like listless Elephants -
Horizons - straggled down -
The Birds rose smiling, in their nests -
The gales - indeed - were done -
Alas, how heedless were the eyes -
On whom the summer shone!
The quiet nonchalance of death -
No Daybreak - can bestir -
The slow - Archangel's syllables
Must awaken
