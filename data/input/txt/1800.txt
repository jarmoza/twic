The Way to know the Bobolink
From every other Bird
Precisely as the Joy of him -
Obliged to be inferred.
Of impudent Habiliment
Attired to defy,
Impertinence  subordinate
At times to Majesty -
Of Sentiments seditious
Amenable to Law -
As Heresies of Transport
Or Puck's Apostacy -
Extrinsic to Attention
Too intimate with Joy -
He compliments Existence
Until allured away
By Seasons or his Children -
Adult and urgent grown -
Or unforeseen Aggrandizement
Or, happily, Renown -
By Contrast certifying
The Bird of Birds is gone -
How nullified the Meadow -
Her Sorcerer withdrawn!
