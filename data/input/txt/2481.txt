All these my banners be.
I sow my pageantry In May --
It rises train by train --
Then sleeps in state again --
My chancel -- all the plain
Today.
To lose -- if one can find again --
To miss -- if one shall meet --
The Burglar cannot rob -- then --
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine --
You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know --
Let us chant it softly --
"There is no more snow!"
To him who keeps an Orchis' heart --
The swamps are pink with June.
