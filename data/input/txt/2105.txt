I saw the wind within her -
I knew it blew for me -
But she must buy my shelter
I asked Humility
I watched the fluttering spirit
That would not intercede
Gibraltar could surrender
But not this little maid -
Precisely how it ended -
Redemption is the one
Of whom the explanation
Is hitherto unknown -
The saved have no remembrance
In our competing Days
'Tis still an assistance
But their's forget in praise
