Going to Heaven!
I dont know when -
Pray do not ask me how!
Indeed I'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!
Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you sh'd get there first
Save just a little place for me
Close to the two I lost -
The smallest "Robe" will fit me
And just a bit of "Crown" -
When we are going home -
I'm glad I dont believe it
For it w'd stop my breath -
And I'd like to look a little more
At such a curious Earth!
I am glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the mighty autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.
