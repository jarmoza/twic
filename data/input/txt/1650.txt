So much of Heaven has gone from Earth
That there must be a Heaven
If only to enclose the Saints
To Affidavit given -
The Missionary to the Mole
Must prove there is a Sky
Location doubtless he would plead
But what excuse have I?
Too much of Proof affronts Belief
The will not try
Unless you leave him - then return -
And he has hauled away.
