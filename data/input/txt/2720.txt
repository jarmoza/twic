Read -- Sweet -- how others -- strove --
Till we -- are stouter --
What they -- renounced --
Till we -- are less afraid --
How many times they -- bore the faithful witness --
Till we -- are helped --
As if a Kingdom -- cared!
Read then -- of faith --
That shone above the fagot --
Clear strains of Hymn
The River could not drown --
Brave names of Men --
And Celestial Women --
Passed out -- of Record
Into -- Renown!
