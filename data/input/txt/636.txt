I rose - because He sank -
I thought it would be opposite -
But when his power dropped -
My Soul grew straight.
I cheered my fainting Prince -
I sang firm - even - Chants -
I helped his Film - with Hymn -
And when the Dews drew off
That held his Forehead stiff -
I met him -
Balm to Balm -
I told him Best - must pass
Through this low Arch of Flesh -
No Casque so brave
It spurn the Grave -
I told him Worlds I knew
Where Emperors grew -
Who recollected us
If we were true -
And so with Thews of Hymn -
And Sinew from within -
And ways I knew not that I knew - till then -
I lifted Him -
