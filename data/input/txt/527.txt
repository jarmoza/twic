I tend my flowers for thee -
Bright Absentee!
My Fuschzia's Coral Seams
Rip - while the Sower - dreams -
Geraniums - tint - and spot -
Low Daisies - dot -
My Cactus - splits her Beard
To show her throat -
Carnations - tip their spice -
And Bees - pick up -
A Hyacinth - I hid -
Puts out a Ruffled Head -
And odors fall
From flasks - so small -
You marvel how they held -
Globe Roses - break their satin flake -
Opon my Garden floor -
Yet - though - not there -
I had as lief they bore
No crimson - more -
Thy flower - be gay -
Her Lord - away!
It ill becometh me -
I'll dwell in Calyx - Gray -
How modestly - alway -
Thy Daisy -
Draped for thee!
