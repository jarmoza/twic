I learned - at least - what Home could be -
How ignorant I had been
Of pretty ways of Covenant -
How awkward at the Hymn
Round our new Fireside - but for this -
This pattern - of the way -
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip
Of a Celestial Sea -
What Mornings in our Garden - guessed -
What Bees - for us - to hum -
With only Birds to interrupt
The Ripple of our Theme -
And Task for Both - When Play be done -
Your Problem - of the Brain -
And mine - some foolisher effect -
A Ruffle - or a Tune -
The Afternoons - together spent -
And Twilight - in the Lanes -
Some ministry to poorer lives -
Seen poorest - thro' our gains -
And then Return - and  Night - and Home -
And then away to You to pass -
A new - diviner - Care -
Till Sunrise take us back to Scene -
Transmuted - Vivider -
This seems a Home - And Home is not -
But what that Place could be -
Afflicts me - as a Setting Sun -
Where Dawn - knows how to be -
