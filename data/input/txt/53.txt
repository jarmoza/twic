Sleep is supposed to be
By souls of sanity
The shutting of the eye.
Sleep is the station grand
Down wh', on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!
Morn is supposed to be
By people of degree
The breaking of the Day.
Morning has not occurred!
That shall Aurora be -
East of Eternity -
One with the banner gay -
One in the red array -
That is the break of Day!
