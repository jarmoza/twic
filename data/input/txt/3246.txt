Severer Service of myself
I -- hastened to demand
To fill the awful Vacuum
Your life had left behind --
I worried Nature with my Wheels
When Her's had ceased to run --
When she had put away Her Work
My own had just begun.
I strove to weary Brain and Bone --
To harass to fatigue
The glittering Retinue of nerves --
Vitality to clog
To some dull comfort Those obtain
Who put a Head away
They knew the Hair to --
And forget the color of the Day --
Affliction would not be appeased --
The Darkness braced as firm
As all my strategem had been
The Midnight to confirm --
No Drug for Consciousness -- can be --
Alternative to die
Is Nature's only Pharmacy
For Being's Malady --
