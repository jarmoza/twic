The Snow that never drifts -
The transient, snow
That comes a single time a Year
Is softly driving now -
So thorough in the Tree
At night beneath the star
That it was Febuary's Foot
Experience would swear -
Like Winter as a Face
We stern and former knew
Repaired of all but Loneliness
By Nature's Alibi -
Were every Storm so spice
The Value could not be -
We buy with contrast - Pang is good
As near as memory -
