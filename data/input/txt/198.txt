Tho' my destiny be Fustian -
Her's be damask fine -
Tho' she wear a silver apron -
I, a less divine -
Still, my little Gipsey being
I would far prefer -
Still, my little sunburnt bosom
To her Rosier -
For, when Frosts, their punctual fingers
On her forehead lay,
You and I, and Dr Holland,
Bloom Eternally!
Roses of a steadfast summer
In a steadfast land -
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil -
And no Reapers stand!
