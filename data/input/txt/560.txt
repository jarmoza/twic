Empty my Heart, of Thee -
It's single Artery -
Begin, and leave Thee out -
Simply Extinction's Date -
Much Billow hath the Sea -
One Baltic - They -
Subtract Thyself, in play,
And not enough of me
Is left - to put away -
"Myself" meant Thee -
Erase the Root - no Tree -
Thee - then - no me -
The Heavens stripped -
vast pocket, picked.
