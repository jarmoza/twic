Bereavement in their death to feel
Whom We have never seen -
A Vital Kinsmanship import
Our Soul and their's between -
For Stranger - Strangers do not mourn -
There be Immortal friends
Whom Death see first - 'tis news of this
That paralyze Ourselves -
Who - vital only to Our Thought -
Such Presence bear away
In dying - 'tis as if Our souls
Absconded - suddenly -
