He preached opon "Breadth" till it argued him narrow -
The Broad are too broad to define
And of "Truth" until it proclaimed him a Liar -
The Truth never flaunted a Sign -
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As Gold the Pyrites would shun -
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a Man!
