I could bring You Jewels -- had I a mind to --
But You have enough -- of those --
I could bring You Odors from St Domingo --
Colors -- from Vera Cruz --
Berries of the Bahamas -- have I --
But this little Blaze
Flickering to itself -- in the Meadow --
Suits Me -- more than those --
Never a Fellow matched this Topaz --
And his Emerald Swing --
Dower itself -- for Bobadilo --
Better -- Could I bring?
