Put up my lute!
What of -- my Music!
Since the sole ear I cared to charm --
Passive -- as Granite -- laps My Music --
Sobbing -- will suit -- as well as psalm!
Would but the "Memnon" of the Desert --
Teach me the strain
That vanquished Him --
When He -- surrendered to the Sunrise --
Maybe -- that -- would awaken --  them!
