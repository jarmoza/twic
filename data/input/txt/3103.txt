I could suffice for Him, I knew --
He -- could suffice for Me --
Yet Hesitating Fractions -- Both
Surveyed Infinity --
"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached --
My syllable rebelled --
'Twas face to face with Nature -- forced --
'Twas face to face with God --
Withdrew the Sun -- to Other Wefts --
Withdrew the furthest Star
Before Decision -- stooped to speech --
And then -- be audibler
The Answer of the Sea unto
The Motion of the Moon --
Herself adjust Her Tides -- unto --
Could I -- do else -- with Mine?
