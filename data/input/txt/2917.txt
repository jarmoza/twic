Sweet -- safe -- Houses --
Glad -- gay -- Houses --
Sealed so stately tight --
Lids of Steel -- on Lids of Marble --
Locking Bare feet out --
Brooks of Plush -- in Banks of Satin
Not so softly fall
As the laughter -- and the whisper --
From their People Pearl --
No Bald Death -- affront their Parlors --
No Bold Sickness come
To deface their Stately Treasures --
Anguish -- and the Tomb --
Hum by -- in Muffled Coaches --
Lest they -- wonder Why --
Any -- for the Press of Smiling --
Interrupt -- to die --
