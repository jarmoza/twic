By my Window have I for Scenery
Just a Sea - with a Stem -
If the Bird and the Farmer - deem it a "Pine" -
The Opinion will do - for them -
It has no Port, nor a "Line" - but the Jays -
That split their route to the Sky -
Or a Squirrel, whose giddy Peninsula
May be easier reached - this way -
For Inlands - the Earth is the under side -
And the upper side - is the Sun -
And it's Commerce - if Commerce it have -
Of Spice - I infer from the Odors borne -
Of it's Voice - to affirm - when the Wind is within -
Can the Dumb - define the Divine?
The Definition of Melody - is -
That Definition is none -
It - suggests to our Faith -
They - suggest to our Sight -
When the latter - is put away
I shall meet with Conviction I somewhere met
That Immortality -
Was the Pine at my Window a "Fellow
Of the Royal" Infinity?
Apprehensions - are God's introductions -
To be hallowed - -
