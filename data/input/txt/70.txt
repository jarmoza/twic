When Katie walks, this Simple pair accompany her side, no
When Katie runs unwearied they follow on the road,
When Katie kneels, their loving hands still clasp her pious knee -
Ah! Katie! Smile at Fortune, with two so knit to thee!
And bore her safe away -
Robins, in the tradition
Did cover such with leaves,
But which the cheek -
And which the pall
My scrutiny deceives -
