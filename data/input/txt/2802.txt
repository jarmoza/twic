It will be Summer -- eventually.
Ladies -- with parasols --
Sauntering Gentlemen -- with Canes --
And little Girls -- with Dolls --
Will tint the pallid landscape --
As 'twere a bright Boquet --
Tho' drifted deep, in Parian --
The Village lies -- today --
The Lilacs -- bending many a year --
Will sway with purple load --
The Bees -- will not despise the tune --
Their Forefathers -- have hummed --
The Wild Rose -- redden in the Bog --
The Aster -- on the Hill
Her everlasting fashion -- set --
And Covenant Gentians -- frill --
Till Summer folds her miracle --
As Women -- do -- their Gown --
Or Priests -- adjust the Symbols --
When Sacrament -- is done --
