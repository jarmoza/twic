I think the longest Hour of all
Is when the Cars have come -
And we are waiting for the Coach -
It seems as though the Time -
Indignant - that the Joy was come -
Did block the Gilded Hands -
And would not let the Seconds by -
But slowest instant - ends -
The Pendulum begins to count -
Like little Scholars - loud -
The steps grow thicker - in the Hall -
The Heart begins to crowd -
Then I - my timid service done -
Tho' service 'twas, of Love -
Take up my little Violin -
And further North - remove -
