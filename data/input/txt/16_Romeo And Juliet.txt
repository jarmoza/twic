<CHORUS>	<0%>
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffick of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

</PROLOGUE>
<ACT 1>
</CHORUS>
<SCENE 1>
<Verona. A Public Place.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Sampson and Gregory, armed with swords and bucklers.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<1%>
No. for then we should be colliers.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<1%>
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
I strike quickly, being moved.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<1%>
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<1%>
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runnest away.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<1%>
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<1%>
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<1%>
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
The heads of the maids?
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
They must take it in sense that feel it.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes two of the house of the Montagues.
</GREGORY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Abraham and Balthasar.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I will back thee.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
How! turn thy back and run?
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
Fear me not.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
No, marry; I fear thee!
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>	<2%>
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
I do bite my thumb, sir.
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>	<2%>
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Gregory.>
</STAGE DIR> Is the law of our side if I say ay?
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Sampson.>
</STAGE DIR> No.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<2%>
Do you quarrel, sir?
</GREGORY>
<ABRAHAM>	<2%>
Quarrel, sir! no, sir.
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>	<2%>
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>	<3%>
No better.
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>	<3%>
Well, sir.
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>	<3%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Sampson.>
</STAGE DIR> Say, 'better;' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>	<3%>
Yes, better, sir.
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>	<3%>
You lie.
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>	<3%>
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
<STAGE DIR>
<They fight.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SAMPSON>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Benvolio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<3%>
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
<STAGE DIR>
<Beats down their swords.>
</STAGE DIR>
</BENVOLIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Tybalt.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TYBALT>	<3%>
What! art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn-thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
</TYBALT>
<BENVOLIO>	<3%>
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.
</BENVOLIO>
<TYBALT>	<3%>
What! drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Have at thee, coward!
<STAGE DIR>
<They fight.>
</STAGE DIR>
</TYBALT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter several persons of both houses, who join the...>
<... fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs and partisans.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CITIZENS>	<3%>
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
</CITIZENS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CAPULET>	<3%>
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
</CAPULET>
<LADY CAPULET>	<3%>
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
</LADY CAPULET>
<CAPULET>	<3%>
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
</CAPULET>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Montague and Lady Montague.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MONTAGUE>	<4%>
Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not; let me go.
</MONTAGUE>
<LADY MONTAGUE>	<4%>
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
</LADY MONTAGUE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Prince with his Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PRINCE>	<4%>
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
Will they not hear? What ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
And, Montague, come you this afternoon
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
</PRINCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MONTAGUE>	<4%>
Who set this ancient quarrel new a-broach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>	<4%>
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them; in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd,
Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
</BENVOLIO>
<LADY MONTAGUE>	<5%>
O! where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
</LADY MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>	<5%>
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursu'd my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>	<5%>
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
And makes himself an artificial night.
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good-counsel may the cause remove.
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>	<5%>
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>	<6%>
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
Have you importun'd him by any means?
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>	<6%>
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself, I will not say how true,
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
See where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>	<6%>
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Montague and Lady.>
</STAGE DIR>
</MONTAGUE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Romeo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
Good morrow, cousin.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<6%>
Is the day so young?
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
But new struck nine.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<6%>
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<6%>
Not having that, which having, makes them short.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
In love?
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<6%>
Out—
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
Of love?
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<6%>
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<6%>
Alas! that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<6%>
Alas! that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will.
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:
Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing! of nothing first create.
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<7%>
No, coz, I rather weep.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<7%>
Good heart, at what?
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<7%>
At thy good heart's oppression.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<7%>
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Going.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<7%>
Soft, I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<7%>
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<7%>
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<7%>
What! shall I groan and tell thee?
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<7%>
Groan! why, no;
But sadly tell me who.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<7%>
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will;
Ah! word ill urg'd to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<8%>
I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<8%>
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<8%>
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<8%>
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O! she is rich in beauty; only poor
That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<8%>
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<8%>
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<8%>
Be rul'd by me; forget to think of her.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<8%>
O! teach me how I should forget to think.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<8%>
By giving liberty unto thine eyes:
Examine other beauties.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<8%>
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He, that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<9%>
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
</BENVOLIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 1>
<SCENE 2>
<The Same. A Street.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servant.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CAPULET>	<9%>
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
</CAPULET>
<PARIS>	<9%>
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
</PARIS>
<CAPULET>	<9%>
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
</CAPULET>
<PARIS>	<9%>
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
</PARIS>
<CAPULET>	<9%>
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
Earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparel'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me. <STAGE DIR>
<To Servant, giving him a paper.>
</STAGE DIR> Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
</CAPULET>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Capulet and Paris.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SERVANT>	<10%>
Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons, whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time.
</SERVANT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Benvolio and Romeo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<10%>
Tut! man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<10%>
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<10%>
For what, I pray thee?
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<10%>
For your broken shin.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<10%>
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<10%>
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented, and—Good den, good fellow.
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
God gi' good den. I pray, sir, can you read?
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
Perhaps you have learn'd it without book: but, I pray, can you read any thing you see?
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
Ye say honestly; rest you merry!
</SERVANT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Offering to go.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
Stay, fellow; I can read.
Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio, and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.
A fair assembly: whither should they come?
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
Up.
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
Whither?
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
To supper; to our house.
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
Whose house?
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
My master's.
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
Indeed, I should have asked you that before.
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<11%>
Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!
</SERVANT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<11%>
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's,
Sups the fair Rosaline, whom thou so lov'st,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<11%>
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires!
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<12%>
Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<12%>
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of mine own.
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 2>
<SCENE 3>
<The Same. A Room in Capulet's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LADY CAPULET>	<12%>
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<12%>
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,—
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid! where's this girl? what, Juliet!
</NURSE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Juliet.>
</STAGE DIR>
<JULIET>	<12%>
How now! who calls?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<12%>
Your mother.
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<12%>
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
</JULIET>
<LADY CAPULET>	<12%>
This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile.
We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<12%>
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<12%>
She's not fourteen.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<12%>
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth—
And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four—
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<13%>
A fortnight and odd days.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<13%>
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!—
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me. But, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua.
Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool!
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.
'Shake,' quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand high lone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before she broke her brow:
And then my husband—God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man—took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my halidom,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
To see now how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<14%>
Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<14%>
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<14%>
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?
</LADY CAPULET>
<JULIET>	<14%>
It is an honour that I dream not of.
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<14%>
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief,
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<14%>
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world—why, he's a man of wax.
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<14%>
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<15%>
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story:
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him making yourself no less.
</LADY CAPULET>
<NURSE>	<15%>
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
</NURSE>
<LADY CAPULET>	<15%>
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
</LADY CAPULET>
<JULIET>	<15%>
I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

<ROMEO>	<16%>
What! shall this speech be spoke for our excuse,
Or shall we on without apology?
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<16%>
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hood-wink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But, let them measure us by what they will,
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<16%>
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<16%>
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<16%>
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<16%>
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<16%>
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<16%>
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<16%>
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<16%>
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in:
<STAGE DIR>
<Putting on a masque.>

A visor for a visor! what care I,
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
</MERCUTIO>

Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<17%>
A torch for me; let wantons, light of heart,
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.
If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire,
Of—save your reverence—love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<17%>
Nay, that's not so.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<17%>
And we mean well in going to this masque;
But 'tis no wit to go.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
Why, may one ask?
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<17%>
I dream'd a dream to-night.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
And so did I.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<17%>
Well, what was yours?
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
That dreamers often lie.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<17%>
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<17%>
Queen Mab! What's she?
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<17%>
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coach-makers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream;
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometimes comes she with a tithe pig's tail,
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice;
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish bladed,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes;
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she—
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<19%>
Peace, peace! Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<19%>
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<19%>
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<19%>
I fear too early; for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels, and expire the term
Of a despised life clos'd in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But he, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail!, On, lusty gentlemen.

Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagu'd with corns will walk a bout with you.
Ah ha! my mistresses, which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she,
I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor, and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
Such as would please; 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
A hall! a hall! give room, and foot it, girls.
<STAGE DIR>
<Music plays, and they dance.>
</STAGE DIR>
More light, ye knaves! and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room has grown too hot.
Ah! sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
For you and I are past our dancing days;
How long is 't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
</CAPULET>
<CAPULET 2>	<20%>
By'r Lady, thirty years.
</CAPULET 2>
<CAPULET>	<20%>
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
</CAPULET>
<CAPULET 2>	<21%>
'Tis more, 'tis more; his son is older, sir.
His son is thirty.

<CAPULET>	<21%>
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

What lady is that which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>	<21%>
I know not, sir.
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>	<21%>
O! she doth teach the torches to burn bright.
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
</ROMEO>
<TYBALT>	<21%>
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What! dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antick face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
</TYBALT>
<CAPULET>	<21%>
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
</CAPULET>
<TYBALT>	<21%>
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
</TYBALT>
<CAPULET>	<21%>
Young Romeo, is it?
</CAPULET>
<TYBALT>	<21%>
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
</TYBALT>
<CAPULET>	<21%>
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone:
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
I would not for the wealth of all this town
Here in my house do him disparagement;
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
</CAPULET>
<TYBALT>	<22%>
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.
</TYBALT>
<CAPULET>	<22%>
He shall be endur'd:
What! goodman boy; I say, he shall, go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
</CAPULET>
<TYBALT>	<22%>
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
</TYBALT>
<CAPULET>	<22%>
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy—is't so indeed?—
This trick may chance to scathe you.—I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What! cheerly, my hearts!
</CAPULET>
<TYBALT>	<22%>

Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Tempering extremity with extreme sweet.

He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<25%>
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rime and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' couple but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word.
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid.
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<25%>
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<25%>
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<26%>
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<26%>
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
O Romeo! that she were, O! that she were
An open et cætera, thou a poperin pear.
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

<Juliet appears above at a window.>
</STAGE DIR>
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady; O! it is my love:
O! that she knew she were.
She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand:
O! that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<27%>
Ay me!
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<27%>
She speaks:
O! speak again, bright angel; for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds,
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<27%>
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father, and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself though, not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O! be some other name:
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<28%>
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<28%>
What man art thou, that, thus bescreen'd in night,
So stumblest on my counsel?
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<28%>
By a name
I know not how to tall thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee:
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<28%>
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<28%>
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<28%>
How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<28%>
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<28%>
If they do see thee they will murder thee.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<28%>
Alack! there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<28%>
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<28%>
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes;
And but thou love me, let them find me here;
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<29%>
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<29%>
By Love, that first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<29%>
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay;'
And I will take thy word; yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo!
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou over-heard'st, ere I was 'ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<29%>
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<29%>
O! swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<30%>
What shall I swear by?
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<30%>
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<30%>
If my heart's dear love—
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<30%>
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say it lightens. Sweet, good-night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good-night, good-night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<30%>
O! wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<30%>
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<30%>
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<30%>
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<30%>
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<30%>
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
<STAGE DIR>

Three words, dear Romeo, and good-night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where, and what time, thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay,
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

At the hour of nine.

I will not fail; 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
</JULIET>

Let me stand here till thou remember it.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<32%>
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<32%>
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<32%>
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone;
And yet no further than a wanton's bird,
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<32%>
I would I were thy bird.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<32%>
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good-night, good-night! parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good-night till it be morrow.

<The Same. Friar Laurence's Cell.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Friar Laurence, with a basket.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<32%>
The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O! mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
And vice sometime's by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed foes encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Romeo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<33%>
Good morrow, father!
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<33%>
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-rous'd by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<34%>
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<34%>
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<34%>
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<34%>
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<34%>
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo!
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<34%>
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<34%>
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<34%>
Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here;
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria! what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline;
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo! here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then:
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<35%>
Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<35%>
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<35%>
And bad'st me bury love.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<35%>
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<35%>
I pray thee, chide not; she, whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<35%>
O! she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<35%>
O! let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<35%>
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MERCUTIO>	<35%>
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<36%>
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<36%>
Why that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<36%>
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<36%>
A challenge, on my life.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<36%>
Romeo will answer it.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<36%>
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<36%>
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<36%>
Alas! poor Romeo, he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<36%>
Why, what is Tybalt?
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<36%>
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O! he is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom; the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah! the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay!
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<36%>
The what?
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<36%>
The pox of such antick, lisping, affecting fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents!—'By Jesu, a very good blade!—a very tall man! a very good whore.'—Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-mois, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bons, their bons!
</MERCUTIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Romeo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<37%>
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to be-rime her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
Meaning—to curtsy.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
A most courteous exposition.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
Pink for flower.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
Right.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
Why, then, is my pump well flowered.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<37%>
Well said; follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<37%>
O single-soled jest! solely singular for the singleness.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wit faints.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<38%>
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<38%>
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<38%>
Nay, good goose, bite not.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<38%>
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
O! here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<38%>
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<38%>
Stop there, stop there.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<38%>
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<38%>
O! thou art deceived; I would have made it short; for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.

One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.

By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' quoth a'?—Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
</NURSE>
<ROMEO>	<39%>
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

You say well.
</NURSE>
<MERCUTIO>	<39%>
Yea! is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely, wisely.

An a' speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skeins-mates. <STAGE DIR>

I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.
</PETER>
<NURSE>	<40%>
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you out; what she bid me say I will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
</NURSE>
<ROMEO>	<40%>
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto thee,—
</ROMEO>
<NURSE>	<41%>
Good heart! and i' faith, I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
</NURSE>
<ROMEO>	<41%>
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

<ROMEO>	<41%>
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell,
Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

And stay, good nurse; behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell! Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
Farewell! Commend me to thy mistress.

<NURSE>	<41%>
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

<ROMEO>	<41%>
What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
</ROMEO>
<NURSE>	<41%>
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
</NURSE>
<ROMEO>	<41%>
I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
</ROMEO>
<NURSE>	<41%>
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady—Lord, Lord!—when 'twas a little prating thing,—O! there's a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
</NURSE>
<ROMEO>	<42%>
Ay, nurse: what of that? both with an R.
</ROMEO>
<NURSE>	<42%>
Ah! mocker; that's the dog's name. R is for the—No; I know it begins with some other letter: and she had the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.

Commend me to thy lady.

<NURSE>	<42%>
Ay, a thousand times. <STAGE DIR>

<JULIET>	<42%>
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promis'd to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O! she is lame: love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections, and warm youthful blood,
She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Nurse and Peter.>
</STAGE DIR>
O God! she comes. O honey nurse! what news?
</JULIET>
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
<NURSE>	<43%>
Peter, stay at the gate.
</NURSE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Peter.>
</STAGE DIR>
<JULIET>	<43%>
Now, good sweet nurse; O Lord! why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<43%>
I am aweary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<43%>
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<43%>
Jesu! what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<43%>
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is 't good or bad?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<43%>
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God. What! have you dined at home?
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<43%>
No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<44%>
Lord! how my head aches; what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t'other side; O! my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<44%>
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<44%>
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<44%>
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<44%>
O! God's lady dear,
Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<44%>
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<44%>
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<44%>
I have.
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<44%>
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell,
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark;
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<45%>
So smile the heaven upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<45%>
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<45%>
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which, as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Juliet.>
</STAGE DIR>
Here comes the lady: O! so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
<JULIET>	<45%>
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<45%>
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<JULIET>	<45%>
As much to him, else are his thanks too much.
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>	<45%>
Ah! Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>	<45%>
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth.
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<46%>
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

<ACT 3>
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<SCENE 1>
<Verona. A Public Place.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page, and Servants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<46%>
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not 'scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<46%>
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when, indeed, there is no need.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<46%>
Am I like such a fellow?
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<46%>
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<46%>
And what to?
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<46%>
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye, but such an eye, would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another, for tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<47%>
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<47%>
The fee-simple! O simple!
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<47%>
By my head, here come the Capulets.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<47%>
By my heel, I care not.
</MERCUTIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Tybalt, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TYBALT>	<47%>
Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Gentlemen, good den! a word with one of you.
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>	<47%>
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>	<47%>
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>	<47%>
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>	<47%>
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,—
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>	<47%>
Consort! What! dost thou make us minstrels? an thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. 'Zounds! consort!
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<47%>
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
Or reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<48%>
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
</MERCUTIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Romeo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TYBALT>	<48%>
Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>	<48%>
But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>	<48%>
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,—thou art a villain.
</TYBALT>
<ROMEO>	<48%>
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting; villain am I none,
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
</ROMEO>
<TYBALT>	<48%>
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
</TYBALT>
<ROMEO>	<48%>
I do protest I never injur'd thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet, which name I tender
As dearly as my own, be satisfied.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<48%>
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
<STAGE DIR>
<Draws.>
</STAGE DIR>
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>	<48%>
What wouldst thou have with me?
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>	<48%>
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>	<48%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Drawing.>
</STAGE DIR> I am for you.
</TYBALT>
<ROMEO>	<49%>
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

Come, sir, your passado.
</MERCUTIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<They fight.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<49%>
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets.
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Tybalt and his Partisans.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MERCUTIO>	<49%>
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>	<49%>
What! art thou hurt?
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>	<49%>
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
</MERCUTIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Page.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<49%>
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<49%>
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>	<49%>
I thought all for the best.
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>	<49%>
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too:—your houses!
</MERCUTIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<49%>
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander, Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet!
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Benvolio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<50%>
O Romeo, Romeo! brave Mercutio's dead;
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe others must end.
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Tybalt.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<50%>
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<50%>
Alive! in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again
That late thou gav'st me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
</ROMEO>
<TYBALT>	<50%>
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
</TYBALT>
<ROMEO>	<50%>
This shall determine that.
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<They fight: Tybalt falls.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BENVOLIO>	<50%>
Romeo, away! be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amaz'd: the prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken: hence! be gone! away!
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>	<50%>
O! I am Fortune's fool.
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>	<50%>
Why dost thou stay?

Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

<BENVOLIO>	<51%>
There lies that Tybalt.

<CITIZEN 1>	<51%>
Up, sir, go with me.
I charge thee in the prince's name, obey.

</STAGE DIR>
<PRINCE>	<51%>
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
</PRINCE>
<BENVOLIO>	<51%>
O noble prince! I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
</BENVOLIO>
<LADY CAPULET>	<51%>
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O! the blood is spill'd
Of my dear kinsman. Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!
</LADY CAPULET>
<PRINCE>	<51%>
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
</PRINCE>
<BENVOLIO>	<51%>
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay:
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
Your high displeasure: all this, uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I.
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain,
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
</BENVOLIO>
<LADY CAPULET>	<52%>
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
</LADY CAPULET>
<PRINCE>	<52%>
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
</PRINCE>
<MONTAGUE>	<52%>
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend,
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
</MONTAGUE>
<PRINCE>	<52%>
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses;
Therefore use none; let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

<JULIET>	<53%>
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phœbus' lodging; such a waggoner
As Phæthon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!
That runaway's eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen!
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night! come, Romeo! come, thou day in night!
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo: and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O! I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O! here comes my nurse,
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Nurse with cords.>
</STAGE DIR>
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords

Ay, ay, the cords.

<NURSE>	<54%>
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot. O! Romeo, Romeo;
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<54%>
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel, 'I,' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an 'I;'
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I;' or if not 'no:'
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<54%>
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the mark! here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore blood; I swounded at the sight.
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<54%>
O break, my heart!—poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<54%>
O Tybalt, Tybalt! the best friend I had:
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<55%>
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living if those two are gone?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<55%>
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo, that kill'd him, he is banished.

O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O, nature! what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O! that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace.

For such a wish! he was not born to shame:

Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah! poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But O! it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished!'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished!' to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.—
Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

Hence from Verona art thou banished.

</FRIAR LAURENCE>

There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death; then 'banished,'
Is death mis-term'd. Calling death 'banished,'
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<58%>
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<58%>
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me? 'Banished!'
O friar! the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished?'
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<59%>
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>	<59%>
Yet 'banished!' Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,

And fall upon the ground, as I do now,

Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man;
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thes at once, which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie! thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love, sworn, but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
To set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What! rouse thee, man; thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend,
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her;
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on you pomegranate tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops:
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:

Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
O! now I would they had chang'd voices too,
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunts-up to the day.

God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

<CAPULET>	<69%>
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;

<LADY CAPULET>	<70%>
You are too hot.
</LADY CAPULET>
<CAPULET>	<70%>
God's bread! it makes me mad.
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd; and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed,' 'I cannot love,'
'I am too young,' 'I pray you, pardon me;'
But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O! sweet my mother, cast me not away:
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
</JULIET>

Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

O God! O nurse! how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack! that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What sayst thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<71%>
Faith, here it is. Romeo
Is banished; and all the world to nothing
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O! he's a lovely gentleman;
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<71%>
Speakest thou from thy heart?
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<71%>
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.

<JULIET>	<71%>
Amen!
</JULIET>
<NURSE>	<71%>
What!
</NURSE>
<JULIET>	<71%>
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolv'd.

Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

<JULIET>	<72%>
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue

So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

<ACT 4>
</JULIET>
<SCENE 1>
<Verona. Friar Laurence's Cell.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Friar Laurence and Paris.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<72%>
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<PARIS>	<72%>
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
</PARIS>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<72%>
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<PARIS>	<72%>
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
</PARIS>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<72%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Juliet.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PARIS>	<72%>
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<72%>
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
</JULIET>
<PARIS>	<72%>
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
What must be shall be.
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<73%>
That's a certain text.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<PARIS>	<73%>
Come you to make confession to this father?
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
To answer that, I should confess to you.
</JULIET>
<PARIS>	<73%>
Do not deny to him that you love me.
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
I will confess to you that I love him.
</JULIET>
<PARIS>	<73%>
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
</JULIET>
<PARIS>	<73%>
Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.
</JULIET>
<PARIS>	<73%>
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
</JULIET>
<PARIS>	<73%>
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
</PARIS>
<JULIET>	<73%>
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<73%>
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now:
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<PARIS>	<73%>
God shield, I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
</PARIS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<JULIET>	<73%>
O! shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<73%>
Ah! Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<JULIET>	<74%>
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently,
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
Give me some present counsel; or behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<74%>
Hold, daughter; I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;
And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<JULIET>	<74%>
O! bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks, and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<75%>
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow!
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou liv'st;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then—as the manner of our country is—
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come; and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
If no unconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<JULIET>	<76%>
Give me, give me! O! tell me not of fear!
</JULIET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<76%>
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<JULIET>	<76%>
Love, give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!

You shall have none ill, sir; for
I'll try if they can lick their fingers.
</SERVANT 2>
<CAPULET>	<76%>
How canst thou try them so?
</CAPULET>
<SERVANT 2>	<76%>
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

Go, be gone.

Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

<JULIET>	<77%>
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
</JULIET>
<CAPULET>	<77%>
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
</CAPULET>
<JULIET>	<77%>
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
</JULIET>
<CAPULET>	<77%>
Why, I'm glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.
</CAPULET>
<JULIET>	<77%>
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
</JULIET>
<LADY CAPULET>	<77%>
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

Tush! I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
To County Paris; to prepare him up
Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.

<Enter Lady Capulet.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LADY CAPULET>	<78%>
What! are you busy, ho? need you my help?
</LADY CAPULET>
<JULIET>	<78%>
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.
</JULIET>
<LADY CAPULET>	<78%>
Good-night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
</LADY CAPULET>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.>
</STAGE DIR>
<JULIET>	<78%>
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no; this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
<STAGE DIR>
<Laying down a dagger.>
</STAGE DIR>
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
I will not entertain so bad a thought.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort:
Alack, alack! is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:
O! if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears,
And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

What! not a word? you take your pennyworths now:
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!

Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now

O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! dead! alack, my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried!
</CAPULET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<83%>
Peace, ho! for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion,
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O! in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church;
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<CAPULET>	<84%>
All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.
</CAPULET>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<84%>
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

Musicians! O! musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's ease:' O! an ye will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
</PETER>
<MUSICIAN 1>	<84%>
Why 'Heart's ease?'
</MUSICIAN 1>
<PETER>	<84%>
O! musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe;' O! play me some merry dump, to comfort me.

Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

Why 'silver sound?' why 'music with her silver sound?' What say you, Simon Catling?

Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

Faith, I know not what to say.

<ACT 5>
</MUSICIAN 2>
<SCENE 1>
<Mantua. A Street.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Romeo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<85%>
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead;—
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think,—
And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv'd, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Balthasar, booted.>
</STAGE DIR>
News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
</ROMEO>
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<BALTHASAR>	<86%>
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill;
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you.
O! pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
</BALTHASAR>
<ROMEO>	<86%>
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
</ROMEO>
<BALTHASAR>	<86%>
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.
</BALTHASAR>
<ROMEO>	<86%>
Tush, thou art deceiv'd;
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
</ROMEO>
<BALTHASAR>	<86%>
No, my good lord.
</BALTHASAR>
<ROMEO>	<86%>
No matter; get thee gone,
And hire those horses: I'll be with thee straight.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Balthasar.>
</STAGE DIR>
Well, Juliet, I will he with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief! thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
I do remember an apothecary,
And hereabouts he dwells, which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O! this same thought did but fore-run my need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house:
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Apothecary.>
</STAGE DIR>
<APOTHECARY>	<87%>
Who calls so loud?
</APOTHECARY>
<ROMEO>	<87%>
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor;
Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
As violently as hasty powder fir'd
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
</ROMEO>
<APOTHECARY>	<88%>
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.
</APOTHECARY>
<ROMEO>	<88%>
Art thou so bare, and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hang upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law:
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
</ROMEO>
<APOTHECARY>	<88%>
My poverty, but not my will, consents.
</APOTHECARY>
<ROMEO>	<88%>
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
</ROMEO>
<APOTHECARY>	<88%>
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
</APOTHECARY>
<ROMEO>	<88%>
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
Farewell; buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.
</ROMEO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>

</SCENE 1>
<SCENE 2>
<Verona. Friar Laurence's Cell.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Friar John.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR JOHN>	<88%>
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
</FRIAR JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Friar Laurence.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<88%>
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<FRIAR JOHN>	<88%>
Going to find a bare-foot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
</FRIAR JOHN>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<89%>
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<FRIAR JOHN>	<89%>
I could not send it, here it is again,
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.
</FRIAR JOHN>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<89%>
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge
Of dear import; and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<FRIAR JOHN>	<89%>
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
</FRIAR JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<89%>
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within these three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantus,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come:
Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 2>
<SCENE 3>
<The Same. A Churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Paris, and his Page, bearing flowers and a torch.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PARIS>	<89%>
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof;
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground:
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee; go.
</PARIS>
<PAGE>	<90%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
</PAGE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Retires.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PARIS>	<90%>
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
<STAGE DIR>
<The Page whistles.>
</STAGE DIR>
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What! with a torch?—muffle me, night, awhile.
<STAGE DIR>
<Retires.>
</STAGE DIR>
</PARIS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Romeo and Balthasar, with a torch, mattock, &c.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<90%>
Give me that mattock, and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly, to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
</ROMEO>
<BALTHASAR>	<91%>
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
</BALTHASAR>
<ROMEO>	<91%>
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
</ROMEO>
<BALTHASAR>	<91%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> For all this same, I'll hide me here about:
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
</BALTHASAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Retires.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<91%>
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
<STAGE DIR>
<Opens the tomb.>
</STAGE DIR>
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
</ROMEO>
<PARIS>	<91%>
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.—
<STAGE DIR>
<Comes forward.>
</STAGE DIR>
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague,
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
</PARIS>
<ROMEO>	<91%>
I must, indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury: O! be gone:
By heaven, I love thee better than myself.
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
</ROMEO>
<PARIS>	<92%>
I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
</PARIS>
<ROMEO>	<92%>
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
</ROMEO>

<STAGE DIR>
<Falls.>
</STAGE DIR> O, I am slain!—If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
</PARIS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ROMEO>	<92%>
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face:
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O! give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book:
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O, no! a lanthorn, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd,
<STAGE DIR>
<Laying Paris in the tomb.>
</STAGE DIR>
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O! how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O! what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah! dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids; O! here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love! <STAGE DIR>
<Drinks.>
</STAGE DIR> O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Laurence, with a lanthorn, crow, and spade.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<93%>
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<94%>
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
</BALTHASAR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<94%>
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<94%>
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.
</BALTHASAR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<94%>
Who is it?
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<94%>
Romeo.
</BALTHASAR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<94%>
How long hath he been there?
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<94%>
Full half an hour.
</BALTHASAR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<94%>
Go with me to the vault.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<94%>
I dare not, sir.
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.
</BALTHASAR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<94%>
Stay then, I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me;
O! much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<94%>
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.
</BALTHASAR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<94%>
<STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> Romeo!
Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the tomb.>
</STAGE DIR>
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what! Paris too?
And steep'd in blood? Ah! what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance.
The lady stirs.

<JULIET>	<94%>
O, comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
</JULIET>
<STAGE DIR>
<Noise within.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<95%>
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents: come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too: come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet.—<STAGE DIR>
<Noise again.>
</STAGE DIR> I dare no longer stay.
</FRIAR LAURENCE>
<JULIET>	<95%>
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Friar Laurence.>
</STAGE DIR>
What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after! I will kiss thy lips;
Haply, some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses him.>

Thy lips are warm!

Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince, run to the Capulets,
Raise up the Montagues, some others search:
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt others of the Watch.>

<Re-enter other of the Watch, with Friar Laurence.>

<CAPULET>	<96%>
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

What fear is this which startles in our ears?
</PRINCE>

Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;

O, heaven!—O wife! look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en!—for, lo, his house

And is mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.

Alas! my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?

<MONTAGUE>	<97%>
O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?

<PRINCE>	<97%>
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<97%>
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place

Myself condemned and myself excus'd.

<PRINCE>	<97%>
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

<FRIAR LAURENCE>	<98%>
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stolen marriage-day
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce,
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her,—so tutor'd by my art,—
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then, all alone,
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But, when I came,—some minute ere the time
Of her awakening,—here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience;
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
</PRINCE>
<BALTHASAR>	<99%>
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not and left him there.
</BALTHASAR>
<PRINCE>	<99%>
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
</PRINCE>
<PAGE>	<99%>
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did;
Anon, comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
</PAGE>
<PRINCE>	<99%>
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies?—Capulet! Montague!
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love;
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
</PRINCE>
<CAPULET>	<100%>
O brother Montague! give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.
</CAPULET>
<MONTAGUE>	<100%>
But I can give thee more;
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known.
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
</MONTAGUE>
<CAPULET>	<100%>
As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
</CAPULET>
<PRINCE>	<100%>
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things:
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
