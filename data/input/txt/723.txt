The Trees like Tassels - hit - and swung -
There seemed to rise a Tune
From Miniature Creatures
Accompanying the Sun -
Far Psalteries of Summer -
Enamoring the Ear
They never yet did satisfy -
Remotest - when most fair
The Sun shone whole at intervals -
Then Half - then utter hid -
As if Himself were optional
And had Estates of Cloud
Sufficient to enfold Him
Eternally from view -
Except it were a whim of His
To let the Orchards grow -
A Bird sat careless on the fence -
One gossipped in the Lane
On silver matters charmed a Snake
Just winding round a stone -
Bright Flowers slit a Calyx
And soared opon a stem
Like Hindered Flags - Sweet hoisted -
With Spices - in the Hem -
'Twas more - I cannot -
How mean - to those that see -
Delineation
Of Nature's - Summer Day!
