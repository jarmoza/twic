To disappear enhances --
The Man that runs away
Is tinctured for an instant
With Immortality
But yesterday a Vagrant --
Today in Memory lain
With superstitious value
We tamper with "Again"
But "Never" far as Honor
Withdraws the Worthless thing
And impotent to cherish
We hasten to adorn --
Of Death the sternest function
That just as we discern
The Excellence defies us --
Securest gathered then
The Fruit perverse to plucking,
But leaning to the Sight
Wide the extatic limit
Of unobtained Delight
