That after Horror - that 'twas -
That passed the mouldering Pier -
Just as the Granite crumb let go -
Our Savior, by a Hair -
A second more, had dropped too deep
For Fisherman to plumb -
The very profile of the Thought
Puts Recollection numb -
The possibility - to pass
Without a moment's Bell -
Into Conjecture's presence
Is like a Face of Steel -
That suddenly looks into our's
With a metallic grin -
The Cordiality of Death -
Who drills his Welcome in -
