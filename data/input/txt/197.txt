Though my destiny be fustian
be damask fine -
Though she wear a apron,
I, a less divine,
Still, my little gipsey being,
I would far prefer,
Still my little sunburnt bosom,
To her rosier.
For when frosts their punctual fingers
On her forehead lay,
You and I and Doctor Holland
Bloom eternally.
Roses of a steadfast summer
In a steadfast land,
Where no autumn lifts her pencil,
And no reapers stand.
