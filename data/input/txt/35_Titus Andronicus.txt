<Scene.—Rome, and the Country near it.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ACT 1>
<SCENE 1>
<Rome.>
<STAGE DIR>
<The Tomb of the Andronici appearing. The Tribunes...>
<... and Senators aloft; and then enter Saturninus...>
<... and his Followers at one door, and Bassianus and...>
<... his Followers at the other, with drum and colours.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<1%>
Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
And, countrymen, my loving followers,
Plead my successive title with your swords:
I am his first-born son that was the last
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
Then let my father's honours live in me,
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<1%>
Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
If ever Bassianus, Cæsar's son,
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
Keep then this passage to the Capitol,
And suffer not dishonour to approach
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
To justice, continence, and nobility;
But let desert in pure election shine,
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Marcus Andronicus, aloft, with the crown.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<1%>
Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
Ambitiously for rule and empery,
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
A special party, have, by common voice,
In election for the Roman empery,
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius,
For many good and great deserts to Rome:
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
Lives not this day within the city walls:
He by the senate is accited home
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
Hath yok'd a nation, strong, train'd up in arms.
Ten years are spent since first he undertook
This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
In coffins from the field;
And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
And in the Capitol and senate's right,
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
</MARCUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<2%>
How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<2%>
Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
In thy uprightness and integrity,
And so I love and honour thee and thine,
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
And to my fortunes and the people's favour
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt the Followers of Bassianus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<2%>
Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
I thank you all and here dismiss you all;
And to the love and favour of my country
Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt the Followers of Saturninus.>
</STAGE DIR>
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
As I am confident and kind to thee.
Open the gates, and let me in.
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<3%>
Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. They go up into the Senate-house.>
</STAGE DIR>
</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Captain.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CAPTAIN>	<3%>
Romans, make way! the good Andronicus,
Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
Successful in the battles that he fights,
With honour and with fortune is return'd
From where he circumscribed with his sword,
And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
</CAPTAIN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Drums and trumpets sounded, and then enter Martius...>
<... and Mutius; after them two Men bearing a coffin...>
<... covered with black; then Lucius and Quintus. After...>
<... them Titus Andronicus; and then Tamora, with Alarbus,...>
<... Chiron, Demetrius, Aaron, and other Goths, prisoners;...>
<... Soldiers and people following. The bearers set down the coffin, and Titus speaks.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<3%>
Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
Lo! as the bark, that hath discharg'd her fraught,
Returns with precious lading to the bay
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
To re-salute his country with his tears,
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
Thou great defender of this Capitol,
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons,
Half of the number that King Priam had,
Behold the poor remains, alive, and dead!
These that survive let Rome reward with love;
These that I bring unto their latest home.
With burial among their ancestors:
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
Make way to lay them by their brethren.
<STAGE DIR>
<The tomb is opened.>
</STAGE DIR>
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
O sacred receptacle of my joys,
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
That thou wilt never render to me more!
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<4%>
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
Before this earthy prison of their bones;
That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<5%>
I give him you, the noblest that survives
The eldest son of this distressed queen.
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<5%>
Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
A mother's tears in passion for her son:
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
O! think my son to be as dear to me.
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
To beautify thy triumphs and return,
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets
For valiant doings in their country's cause?
O! if to fight for king and commonweal
Were piety in thine, it is in these.
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
Draw near them then in being merciful;
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<5%>
Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<5%>
Away with him! and make a fire straight;
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
</LUCIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lucius, Quintus, Martius, and Mutius, with Alarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TAMORA>	<6%>
O cruel, irreligious piety!
</TAMORA>
<CHIRON>	<6%>
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
</CHIRON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<6%>
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
To tremble under Titus' threatening look.
Then, madam, stand resolv'd; but hope withal
The self-same gods, that arm'd the Queen of Troy
With opportunity of sharp revenge
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths—
When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen—
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
</DEMETRIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Lucius, Quintus, Martius, and Mutius, with their swords bloody.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIUS>	<6%>
See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
Our Roman rites. Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<6%>
Let it be so; and let Andronicus
Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
<STAGE DIR>
<Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb.>
</STAGE DIR>
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,
No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LAVINIA>	<7%>
In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
My noble lord and father, live in fame!
Lo! at this tomb my tributary tears
I render for my brethren's obsequies;
And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome.
O! bless me here with thy victorious hand,
Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud.
</LAVINIA>
<TITUS>	<7%>
Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Marcus Andronicus and Tribunes; re-enter Saturninus, Bassianus, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<7%>
Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<7%>
Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<7%>
And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
That in your country's service drew your swords;
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness,
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
This palliament of white and spotless hue;
And name thee in election for the empire,
With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
Be candidatus then, and put it on,
And help to set a head on headless Rome.
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<8%>
A better head her glorious body fits
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
And set abroad new business for you all?
Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
And led my country's strength successfully,
And buried one-and-twenty valiant sons,
Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
In right and service of their noble country.
Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
But not a sceptre to control the world:
Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<8%>
Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
</MARCUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<8%>
Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<8%>
Patience, Prince Saturninus.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<9%>
Romans, do me right:
Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
</SATURNINUS>
<LUCIUS>	<9%>
Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<9%>
Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
</TITUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<9%>
Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
But honour thee, and will do till I die:
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
Of noble minds is honourable meed.
</BASSIANUS>
<TITUS>	<9%>
People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
I ask your voices and your suffrages:
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
</TITUS>
<TRIBUNES>	<9%>
To gratify the good Andronicus,
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
The people will accept whom he admits.
</TRIBUNES>
<TITUS>	<9%>
Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
That you create your emperor's eldest son,
Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
And ripen justice in this commonweal:
Then, if you will elect by my advice,
Crown him, and say, 'Long live our emperor!'
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<9%>
With voices and applause of every sort,
Patricians and plebeians, we create
Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
And say, 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
</MARCUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<A long flourish.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<10%>
Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
To us in our election this day,
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
Thy name and honourable family,
Lavinia will I make my empress,
Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<10%>
It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
I hold me highly honour'd of your Grace:
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
King and commander of our commonweal,
The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners;
Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord:
Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<10%>
Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record, and, when I do forget
The least of these unspeakable deserts,
Romans, forget your fealty to me.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<10%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Tamora.>
</STAGE DIR> Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor;
To him that, for your honour and your state,
Will use you nobly and your followers.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<11%>
A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome:
Princely shall be thy usage every way.
Rest on my word, and let not discontent
Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
</SATURNINUS>
<LAVINIA>	<11%>
Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
</LAVINIA>
<SATURNINUS>	<11%>
Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
</SATURNINUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Saturninus courts Tamora in dumb show.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BASSIANUS>	<11%>
Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Seizing Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<11%>
How, sir! Are you in earnest then, my lord?
</TITUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<11%>
Ay, noble Titus; and resolv'd withal
To do myself this reason and this right.
</BASSIANUS>
<MARCUS>	<11%>
Suum cuique is our Roman justice:
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
</MARCUS>
<LUCIUS>	<11%>
And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<12%>
Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surpris'd.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<12%>
Surpris'd! By whom?
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<12%>
By him that justly may
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Marcus and Bassianus with Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MUTIUS>	<12%>
Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
</MUTIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lucius, Quintus, and Martius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<12%>
Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
</TITUS>
<MUTIUS>	<12%>
My lord, you pass not here.
</MUTIUS>
<TITUS>	<12%>
What! villain boy;
Barr'st me my way in Rome?
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Stabs Mutius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MUTIUS>	<12%>
Help, Lucius, help!
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
</MUTIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Lucius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIUS>	<12%>
My lord, you are unjust; and, more than so,
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<12%>
Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
My sons would never so dishonour me.
Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<12%>
Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife
That is another's lawful promis'd love.
</LUCIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<12%>
No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
Was none in Rome to make a stale
But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
Agreed these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<13%>
O monstrous! what reproachful words are these!
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<13%>
But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
To him that flourish'd for her with his sword.
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<13%>
These words are razors to my wounded heart.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<13%>
And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
That like the stately Phœbe 'mongst her nymphs,
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,
Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
And will create thee Empress of Rome.
Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
Sith priest and holy water are so near,
And tapers burn so bright, and every thing
In readiness for Hymenæus stand,
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
I lead espous'd my bride along with me.
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<13%>
And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
She will a handmaid be to his desires,
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
</TAMORA>
<SATURNINUS>	<14%>
Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
Your noble emperor, and his lovely bride,
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
There shall we consummate our spousal rights.
</SATURNINUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all but Titus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<14%>
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Marcus, Lucius, Quintus, and Martius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<14%>
O! Titus, see, O! see what thou hast done;
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<14%>
No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
That hath dishonour'd all our family:
Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<14%>
But let us give him burial, as becomes;
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<14%>
Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb.
This monument five hundred years hath stood,
Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls.
Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<15%>
My lord, this is impiety in you.
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;
He must be buried with his brethren.
</MARCUS>
<QUINTUS>	<15%>
And shall, or him we will accompany.
</QUINTUS>
<MARTIUS>	<15%>
And shall, or him we will accompany.
</MARTIUS>
<TITUS>	<15%>
And shall! What villain was it spake that word?
</TITUS>
<QUINTUS>	<15%>
He that would vouch it in any place but here.
</QUINTUS>
<TITUS>	<15%>
What! would you bury him in my despite?
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<15%>
No, noble Titus; but entreat of thee
To pardon Mutius, and to bury him.
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<15%>
Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:
My foes I do repute you every one;
So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
</TITUS>
<MARTIUS>	<15%>
He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
</MARTIUS>
<QUINTUS>	<15%>
Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
</QUINTUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Marcus and the sons of Titus kneel.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<15%>
Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,—
</MARCUS>
<QUINTUS>	<15%>
Father, and in that name doth nature speak,—
</QUINTUS>
<TITUS>	<15%>
Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<15%>
Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,—
</MARCUS>
<LUCIUS>	<15%>
Dear father, soul and substance of us all,—
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<15%>
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
Did graciously plead for his funerals.
Let not young Mutius then, that was thy joy,
Be barr'd his entrance here.
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<16%>
Rise, Marcus, rise.
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Mutius is put into the tomb.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIUS>	<16%>
There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
</LUCIUS>
<ALL>	<16%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kneeling.>
</STAGE DIR> No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
</ALL>
<MARCUS>	<16%>
My lord,—to step out of these dreary dumps,—
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome?
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<16%>
I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.
Is she not, then, beholding to the man
That brought her for this high good turn so far?
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<16%>
Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
</MARCUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Re-enter, on one side, Saturninus, attended;...>
<... Tamora, Demetrius, Chiron, and Aaron: on the other side, Bassianus, Lavinia and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<16%>
So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<17%>
And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.
</BASSIANUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<17%>
Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<17%>
Rape call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
My true-betrothed love and now my wife?
But let the laws of Rome determine all;
Meanwhile, I am possess'd of that is mine.
</BASSIANUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<17%>
'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
</SATURNINUS>
<BASSIANUS>	<17%>
My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
Answer I must and shall do with my life.
Only thus much I give your Grace to know:
By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
That, in the rescue of Lavinia,
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
In zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,
That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
</BASSIANUS>
<TITUS>	<17%>
Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
How I have lov'd and honour'd Saturnine!
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<17%>
My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
Then hear me speak indifferently for all;
And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
</TAMORA>
<SATURNINUS>	<18%>
What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,
And basely put it up without revenge?
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<18%>
Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
I should be author to dishonour you!
But on mine honour dare I undertake
For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.
Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Saturninus.>
</STAGE DIR> My lord, be rul'd by me, be won at last;
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
You are but newly planted in your throne;
Lest then, the people, and patricians too,
Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
And so supplant you for ingratitude,
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
Yield at entreats, and then let me alone.
I'll find a day to massacre them all,
And raze their faction and their family,
The cruel father, and his traitorous sons,
To whom I sued for my dear son's life;
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aloud.>
</STAGE DIR> Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown:
</TAMORA>
<SATURNINUS>	<19%>
Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<19%>
I thank your majesty, and her, my lord.
These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<19%>
Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
A Roman now adopted happily,
And must advise the emperor for his good.
This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
That I have reconcil'd your friends and you.
For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
My word and promise to the emperor,
That you will be more mild and tractable.
And fear not, lords, and you, Lavinia,
By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
</TAMORA>
<LUCIUS>	<19%>
We do; and vow to heaven and to his highness,
That what we did was mildly, as we might,
Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<19%>
That on mine honour here I do protest.
</MARCUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<19%>
Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<19%>
Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
</TAMORA>
<SATURNINUS>	<19%>
Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,
And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
I do remit these young men's heinous faults:
Stand up.
Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
Come; if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<20%>
To-morrow, an it please your majesty
To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bon jour.

<SCENE 1>
<Rome. Before the Palace. Enter Aaron.>
<AARON>	<20%>
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
Safe out of Fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,
Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach.
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;
So Tamora.
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains,
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
To wait upon this new-made empress.
To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
And see his shipwrack and his commonweal's.
Holla! what storm is this?
</AARON>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Demetrius and Chiron, braving.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DEMETRIUS>	<21%>
Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge
And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.
</DEMETRIUS>
<CHIRON>	<21%>
Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
I am as able and as fit as thou
To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
</CHIRON>
<AARON>	<21%>
Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep the peace.
</AARON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<21%>
Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
Go to; have your lath glu'd within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it.
</DEMETRIUS>
<CHIRON>	<22%>
Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
</CHIRON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<22%>
Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
</DEMETRIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<They draw.>
</STAGE DIR>
<AARON>	<22%>
Why, how now, lords!
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,
And maintain such a quarrel openly?
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
I would not for a million of gold
The cause were known to them it most concerns;
Nor would your noble mother for much more
Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
For shame, put up.
</AARON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<22%>
Not I, till I have sheath'd
My rapier in his bosom, and withal
Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here.
</DEMETRIUS>
<CHIRON>	<22%>
For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd,
Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,
And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform!
</CHIRON>
<AARON>	<22%>
Away, I say!
Now, by the gods that war-like Goths adore,
This petty brabble will undo us all.
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
It is to jet upon a prince's right?
What! is Lavinia then become so loose,
Or Bassianus so degenerate,
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
Young lords, beware! an should the empress know
This discord's ground, the music would not please.
</AARON>
<CHIRON>	<23%>
I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
I love Lavinia more than all the world.
</CHIRON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<23%>
Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
</DEMETRIUS>
<AARON>	<23%>
Why, are ye mad? or know ye not in Rome
How furious and impatient they be,
And cannot brook competitors in love?
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
By this device.
</AARON>
<CHIRON>	<23%>
Aaron, a thousand deaths
Would I propose, to achieve her whom I love.
</CHIRON>
<AARON>	<23%>
To achieve her! how?
</AARON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<23%>
Why mak'st thou it so strange?
She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
She is a woman, therefore may be won;
She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.
What, man! more water glideth by the mill
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother,
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
</DEMETRIUS>
<AARON>	<23%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
</AARON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<23%>
Then why should he despair that knows to court it
With words, fair looks, and liberality?
What! hast thou not full often struck a doe,
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
</DEMETRIUS>
<AARON>	<23%>
Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
Would serve your turns.
</AARON>
<CHIRON>	<24%>
Ay, so the turn were serv'd.
</CHIRON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<24%>
Aaron, thou hast hit it.
</DEMETRIUS>
<AARON>	<24%>
Would you had hit it too!
Then should not we be tir'd with this ado.
Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
To square for this? Would it offend you then
That both should speed?
</AARON>
<CHIRON>	<24%>
Faith, not me.
</CHIRON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<24%>
Nor me, so I were one.
</DEMETRIUS>
<AARON>	<24%>
For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
That you affect; and so must you resolve,
That what you cannot as you would achieve,
You must perforce accomplish as you may.
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
A speedier course than lingering languishment
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
The forest walks are wide and spacious,
And many unfrequented plots there are
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
Single you thither then this dainty doe,
And strike her home by force, if not by words:
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
To villany and vengeance consecrate,
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
And she shall file our engines with advice,
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
But to your wishes' height advance you both.
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;
There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
</AARON>
<CHIRON>	<25%>
Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
</CHIRON>
<DEMETRIUS>	<25%>

To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,
Per Styga, per manes vehor.

The fields are fragrant and the woods are green.

And wake the emperor and his lovely bride,
And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,
That all the court may echo with the noise.
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
To attend the emperor's person carefully:
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.

</STAGE DIR>
<AARON>	<26%>
He that had wit would think that I had none,
To bury so much gold under a tree,
And never after to inherit it.
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
Which, cunningly effected, will beget
A very excellent piece of villany:
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
<STAGE DIR>
<Hides the gold.>

<Enter Tamora.>

<TAMORA>	<27%>
My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
The birds chant melody on every bush,
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind,
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground.
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns,
As if a double hunt were heard at once,
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
And after conflict, such as was suppos'd
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,
When with a happy storm they were surpris'd,
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Be unto us as is a nurse's song
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
</TAMORA>
<AARON>	<28%>
Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
Saturn is dominator over mine:
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
My silence and my cloudy melancholy;
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution?
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
This is the day of doom for Bassianus;
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
And give the king this fatal-plotted scroll.
Now question me no more; we are espied;
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
</AARON>
<TAMORA>	<28%>
Ah! my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life.

To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.

Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
Or is it Dian, habited like her,
Who hath abandoned her holy groves,
To see the general hunting in this forest?
</BASSIANUS>
<TAMORA>	<29%>
Saucy controller of our private steps!
Had I the power that some say Dian had,
Thy temples should be planted presently
With horns, as was Actæon's; and the hounds
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
</TAMORA>
<LAVINIA>	<29%>
Under your patience, gentle empress,
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
And to be doubted that your Moor and you
Are singled forth to try experiments.
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
</LAVINIA>
<BASSIANUS>	<29%>
Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
Spotted, detested, and abominable.
Why are you sequester'd from all your train,
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
If foul desire had not conducted you?
</BASSIANUS>
<LAVINIA>	<29%>
And, being intercepted in your sport,
Great reason that my noble lord be rated
For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;
This valley fits the purpose passing well.

Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
</DEMETRIUS>
<TAMORA>	<30%>
Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
These two have 'tic'd me hither to this place:
A barren detested vale, you see, it is;
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
Would make such fearful and confused cries,
As any mortal body hearing it
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
But straight they told me they would bind me here
Unto the body of a dismal yew,
And leave me to this miserable death:
And then they called me foul adulteress,
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
That ever ear did hear to such effect;
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
This vengeance on me had they executed.
Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.

Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.

<DEMETRIUS>	<31%>
Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her:
First thrash the corn, than after burn the straw.
This minion stood upon her chastity,
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
And with that painted hope she braves your mightiness:
And shall she carry this unto her grave?
</DEMETRIUS>
<CHIRON>	<31%>
An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.

But when ye have the honey ye desire,
Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.

Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
To see her tears; but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
</DEMETRIUS>
<LAVINIA>	<32%>
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
O! do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.

'Tis true! the raven doth not hatch a lark:
Yet have I heard, O! could I find it now,
The lion mov'd with pity did endure
To have his princely paws par'd all away.
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
O! be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
Nothing so kind, but something pitiful.

Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.

Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
Even for his sake am I pitiless.
Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain
To save your brother from the sacrifice;
But fierce Andronicus would not relent:
Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will:
The worse to her, the better lov'd of me.

<LAVINIA>	<33%>
O Tamora! be call'd a gentle queen,
And with thine own hands kill me in this place;
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

What begg'st thou then? fond woman, let me go.

'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.
O! keep me from their worse than killing lust,
And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
Where never man's eye may behold my body:

The unhappy son of old Andronicus;

My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:

Where we decreed to bury Bassianus:
Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.

Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.

Who's this? my niece, that flies away so fast?
Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
And might not gain so great a happiness
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
Alas! a crimson river of warm blood,
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
Coming and going with thy honey breath.
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflower'd thee,
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
Ah! now thou turn'st away thy face for shame;
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
Blushing to be encounter'd with a cloud.
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
O! that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
That I might rail at him to ease my mind.
Sorrow concealed, like to an oven stopp'd,
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
A craftier Tereus hast thou met withal,
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
O! had the monster seen those lily hands
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
He would not, then, have touch'd them for his life;
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
Which that sweet tongue hath made,
He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee:
O! could our mourning ease thy misery.

<TITUS>	<41%>
Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;
And for these bitter tears, which now you see
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
For two and twenty sons I never wept,
Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
<STAGE DIR>
<He throws himself on the ground.>

My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;

O earth! I will befriend thee more with rain,
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow,
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lucius, with his sword drawn.>
</STAGE DIR>
O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death:
And let me say, that never wept before,
</TITUS>
My tears are now prevailing orators.
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
O noble father, you lament in vain:
The tribunes hear you not, no man is by;
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<42%>
Ah! Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,—
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<42%>
Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
They would not pity me, yet plead I must,
All bootless unto them.
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
For that they will not intercept my tale.
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me;
And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;
A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
<STAGE DIR>

But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?

To rescue my two brothers from their death;
For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
My everlasting doom of banishment.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<43%>
O happy man! they have befriended thee.
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Tigers must prey; and Rome affords no prey
But me and mine: how happy art thou then,
From these devourers to be banished!
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Marcus and Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<43%>
Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;
Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.

Will it consume me? let me see it then.

Ay me! this object kills me.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<43%>
Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
What fool hath added water to the sea,
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
My grief was at the height before thou cam'st;
And now, like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
And they have nurs'd this woe, in feeding life;
In bootless prayer have they been held up,
And they have serv'd me to effectless use:
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<44%>
Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<44%>
O! that delightful engine of her thoughts,
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear.
</MARCUS>
<LUCIUS>	<44%>
O! say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<44%>
O! thus I found her straying in the park,
Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer,
That hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound.
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<44%>
It was my dear; and he that wounded her
Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead:
For now I stand as one upon a rock
Environ'd with a wilderness of sea,
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
Expecting ever when some envious surge
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,
And here my brother, weeping at my woes:
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
It would have madded me: what shall I do
Now I behold thy lively body so?
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
Look! Marcus; ah! son Lucius, look on her:
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
</TITUS>
<MARCUS>	<45%>
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
Perchance because she knows them innocent.
</MARCUS>
<TITUS>	<45%>
If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips;
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
Looking all downwards, to behold our cheeks
How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry,
With miry alime left on them by a flood?
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
Plot some device of further misery,
To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
</TITUS>
<LUCIUS>	<46%>
Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.

For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.

Ah! my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
</LUCIUS>
<TITUS>	<46%>
Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
That to her brother which I said to thee:
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.

As far from help as limbo is from bliss.

And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
I am the sea; hark! how her sighs do blow;
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
Then must my earth with her continual tears
Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.

And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
Even in their throats that have committed them.
Come, let me see what task I have to do.
You heavy people, circle me about,
That I may turn me to each one of you,
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
And in this hand the other will I bear.

Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;

Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
What violent hands can she lay on her life?
Ah! wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
To bid Æaeas tell the tale twice o'er,
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
O! handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
Lest we remember still that we have none.
Fie, fie! how franticly I square my talk,
As if we should forget we had no hands,
If Marcus did not name the word of hands.
Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
Here is no drink. Hark, Marcus, what she says;
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs:
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
Brew'd with her sorrow, mash'd upon her cheeks.
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
But I of these will wrest an alphabet,
And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.

<BOY>	<56%>
My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
Ran mad through sorrow; that made me to fear,
Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
And would not, but in fury, fright my youth;
Which made me down to throw my books and fly,
Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt;
And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,

And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?

See, brother, see! note how she quotes the leaves.

Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
By nature made for murders and for rapes.

Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.

O! calm thee, gentle lord; although I know
There is enough written upon this earth
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.

And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
And swear with me, as, with the woeful fere
And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,

Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
And see their blood, or die with this reproach.

And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
You're a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;
And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
And with a gad of steel will write these words,
And lay it by: the angry northern wind
Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad,
And where's your lesson then? Boy, what say you?

His wife but yesternight was brought to bed.
His child is like to her, fair as you are:
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
And tell them both the circumstance of all,
And how by this their child shall be advanc'd,
And be received for the emperor's heir,
And substituted in the place of mine,
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
Hark ye, lords; you see, I have given her physic,

Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
And that it comes from old Andronicus,
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
Ah! Rome. Well, well; I made thee miserable

See, see! thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.

This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock

She laugh'd, and told the Moor, he should not choose
But give them to his master for a present.

Why, didst thou not come from heaven?

From heaven! alas! sir, I never came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.

Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you.

Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace?

Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.

<TITUS>	<72%>
Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,
But give your pigeons to the emperor:
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
Hold, hold; meanwhile, here's money for thy charges.
Give me pen and ink.
Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver a supplication?
</TITUS>
<CLOWN>	<72%>
Ay, sir.
</CLOWN>
<TITUS>	<72%>
Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss his foot; then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.

I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
</CLOWN>
<TITUS>	<73%>
Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come, let me see it.
Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant:
And when thou hast given it to the emperor,
Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.

Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
An emperor of Rome thus overborne,
Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
Of egal justice, us'd in such contempt?
My lords, you know, as do the mightful gods,—
However these disturbers of our peace
Buzz in the people's ears,—there nought hath pass'd,
But even with law, against the wilful sons
Of old Andronicus. And what an if
His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
What's this but libelling against the senate,
And blazoning our injustice every where?
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
Shall be no shelter to these outrages;
But he and his shall know that justice lives
In Saturninus' health; whom, if she sleep,
He'll so awake, as she in fury shall
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<74%>
My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
And rather comfort his distressed plight
Than prosecute the meanest or the best
For these contempts.—<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Why, thus it shall become
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,

Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

</STAGE DIR>
What news with thee, Æmilius?
<ÆMILIUS>	<75%>
Arm, arm, my lord! Rome never had more cause.
The Goths have gather'd head, and with a power
Of high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
They hither march amain, under conduct
Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
As much as ever Coriolanus did.
</ÆMILIUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<76%>
Is war-like Lucius general of the Goths?
These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms.
Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
'Tis he the common people love so much;
Myself hath often heard them say,
When I have walked like a private man,
That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<76%>
Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
</TAMORA>
<SATURNINUS>	<76%>
Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
And will revolt from me to succour him.
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<76%>
King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
And is not careful what they mean thereby,
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
He can at pleasure stint their melody;
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
Then cheer thy spirit; for know, thou emperor,
I will enchant the old Andronicus
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,
The other rotted with delicious feed.
</TAMORA>
<SATURNINUS>	<77%>
But he will not entreat his son for us.
</SATURNINUS>
<TAMORA>	<77%>
If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
With golden promises, that, were his heart
Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Æmilius.>
</STAGE DIR> Go thou before, be our ambassador:
Say that the emperor requests a parley
Of war-like Lucius, and appoint the meeting,
Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.

<SATURNINUS>	<77%>
Æmilius, do this message honourably:
And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.

Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
I have received letters from great Rome,
Which signify what hate they bear their emperor,
And how desirous of our sight they are.
Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs;
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
Let him make treble satisfaction.
</LUCIUS>
<GOTH 1>	<78%>
Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
Led by their master to the flower'd fields,
And be aveng'd on cursed Tamora.
</GOTH 1>
<GOTHS>	<78%>
And, as he saith, so say we all with him.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Goth, leading Aaron, with his Child in his arms.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GOTH 2>	<78%>
Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd,
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
Upon the wasted building, suddenly
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
They never do beget a coal-black calf.
Peace, villain, peace!'—even thus he rates the babe,—
'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
Surpris'd him suddenly, and brought him hither,
To use as you think needful of the man.
</GOTH 2>
<LUCIUS>	<79%>
O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand:
This is the pearl that pleas'd your empress' eye,
And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
Why dost not speak? What! deaf? not a word?
A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree,
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<79%>
Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<79%>
Too like the sire for ever being good.
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
Get me a ladder.
</LUCIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<A ladder brought, which Aaron is made to ascend.>
</STAGE DIR>
<AARON>	<79%>
Lucius, save the child;
And bear it from me to the empress.
If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
That highly may advantage thee to hear:
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<80%>
Say on; and if it please me which thou speak'st,
Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<80%>
An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
'Twill vex'thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,
Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
And this shall all be buried by my death,
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<80%>
Tell on thy mind: I say, thy child shall live.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<80%>
Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<80%>
Who should I swear by? thou believ'st no god:
That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<80%>
What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
Yet, for I know thou art religious,
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
An idiot holds his bauble for a god,
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
That thou ador'st and hast in reverence,
To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up:
Or else I will discover nought to thee.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<81%>
First, know thou, I begot him on the empress.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<81%>
Tut! Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her,
And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<81%>
Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<81%>
Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
That codding spirit had they from their mother,
As sure a card as ever won the set;
That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me
As true a dog as ever fought at head.
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;
I wrote the letter that thy father found,
And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
And, when I had it, drew myself apart,
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his:
And when I told the empress of this sport,
She swounded almost at my pleasing tale,
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
</AARON>
<GOTH 1>	<82%>
What! canst thou say all this, and never blush?
</GOTH 1>
<AARON>	<82%>
Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<82%>
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<82%>
Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
Even now I curse the day, and yet, I think,
Few come within the compass of my curse,
Wherein I did not some notorious ill:
As kill a man, or else devise his death;
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;
Set deadly enmity between two friends;
Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
And bid the owners quench them with their tears,
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
Tut! I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly,
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
Bring down the devil, for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<83%>
If there be devils, would I were a devil,
To live and burn in everlasting fire,
So I might have your company in hell,
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!

Tell him, Revenge is come to join with him,
And work confusion on his enemies.

And what is written shall be executed.

If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.

Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
Witness these trenches made by grief and care;
Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
For our proud empress, mighty Tamora.
Is not thy coming for my other hand?
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<85%>
Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
I am Revenge, sent from the infernal kingdom,
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
Confer with me of murder and of death.
There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
No vast obscurity or misty vale,
Where bloody murder or detested rape
Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<85%>
Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
To be a torment to mine enemies?
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<85%>
I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<85%>
Do me some service ere I come to thee.
Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
Now give some surance that thou art Revenge:
Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels,
And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
And whirl along with thee about the globe.
Provide two proper palfreys, black as jet,
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
Trot like a servile footman all day long,
Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
Until his very downfall in the sea:
And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.

Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are,
And you the empress! but we worldly men
Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.

I will embrace thee in it by and by.

Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
And, being credulous in this mad thought,
I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

How like the empress and her sons you are!
Well are you fitted had you but a Moor:
Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
For well I wot the empress never wags
But in her company there is a Moor;
And would you represent our queen aright,
It were convenient you had such a devil.
But welcome as you are. What shall we do?

Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
To find another that is like to thee,
Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
There is a queen attended by a Moor;
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,
For up and down she doth resemble thee:
I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
They have been violent to me and mine.
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<88%>
Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
Who leads towards Rome a band of war-like Goths,
And bid him come and banquet at thy house:
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
I will bring in the empress and her sons,
The emperor himself, and all thy foes,
And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
What says Andronicus to this device?

<TITUS>	<88%>
Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Marcus.>
</STAGE DIR>
Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
Tell him, the emperor and the empress too
Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
This do thou for my love; and so let him,
</TITUS>
As he regards his aged father's life.
<MARCUS>	<89%>
This will I do, and soon return again.
</MARCUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>

<TAMORA>	<89%>
Now will I hence about thy business,
And take my ministers along with me.
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<89%>
Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
Or else I'll call my brother back again,
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<89%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to her sons.>
</STAGE DIR> What say you, boys? will you abide with him,
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
How I have govern'd our determin'd jest?
Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
And tarry with him till I turn again.
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<89%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I know them all, though they suppose me mad;
And will o'er-reach them in their own devices;
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.

<DEMETRIUS>	<89%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Tamora.>
</STAGE DIR> Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
</DEMETRIUS>
<TAMORA>	<89%>
Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
</TAMORA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Tamora.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<89%>
I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
</TITUS>
<CHIRON>	<89%>
Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
</CHIRON>
<TITUS>	<89%>
Tut! I have work enough for you to do.
Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Publius and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PUBLIUS>	<90%>
What is your will?
</PUBLIUS>
<TITUS>	<90%>
Know you these two?
</TITUS>
<PUBLIUS>	<90%>
The empress' sons,
I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.
</PUBLIUS>
<TITUS>	<90%>
Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd;
The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
And therefore bind them, gentle Publius;
Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them;
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
And now I find it: therefore bind them sure,
And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit. Publius, &c., seize Chiron and Demetrius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHIRON>	<90%>
Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
</CHIRON>
<PUBLIUS>	<90%>
And therefore do we what we are commanded.
Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
</PUBLIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Titus, with Lavinia; she bearing a basin, and he a knife.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<90%>
Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me,
But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
My hand cut off and made a merry jest:
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forc'd.
What would you say if I should let you speak?
Villains! for shame you could not beg for grace.
Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
Whilst that Levinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
The basin that receives your guilty blood.
You know your mother means to feast with me,
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
Hark! villains, I will grind your bones to dust,
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste;
And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
And make two pasties of your shameful heads;
And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
This is the feast that I have bid her to,
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter,
And worse than Procne I will be reveng'd.
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come.
<STAGE DIR>
<He cuts their throats.>
</STAGE DIR>
Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
And with this hateful liquor temper it;
And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd.
Come, come, be every one officious
To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
So, now bring them in, for I will play the cook,
And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies.>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lucius, Marcus and Goths, with Aaron prisoner.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIUS>	<92%>
Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind
That I repair to Rome, I am content.
</LUCIUS>
<GOTH 1>	<92%>
And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
</GOTH 1>
<LUCIUS>	<92%>
Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him,
Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
For testimony of her foul proceedings:
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
I fear the emperor means no good to us.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<92%>
Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<92%>
Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Goths, with Aaron. Trumpets sound.>

The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.

What! hath the firmament more suns than one?
</SATURNINUS>
<LUCIUS>	<93%>
What boots it thee, to call thyself a sun?
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<93%>
Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
These quarrels must be quietly debated.
The feast is ready which the careful Titus
Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.
</MARCUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<93%>
Marcus, we will.
<STAGE DIR>
<Hautboys sound.>

<Enter Titus, dressed like a cook, Lavinia, veiled,...>
<... young Lucius, and Others. Titus places the dishes on the table.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<93%>
Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
Welcome, ye war-like Goths; welcome, Lucius;
And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<93%>
Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<93%>
Because I would be sure to have all well
To entertain your highness, and your empress.
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<93%>
We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<93%>
An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
Was it well done of rash Virginius
To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
It was, Andronicus.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<94%>
Your reason, mighty lord?
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
Because the girl should not survive her shame,
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<94%>
A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
For me most wretched, to perform the like.
Die, die. Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kills Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<94%>
Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
I am as woeful as Virginius was,
And have a thousand times more cause than he
To do this outrage: and it is now done.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
What! was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<94%>
Will 't please you eat? will 't please your highness feed?
</TITUS>
<TAMORA>	<94%>
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
</TAMORA>
<TITUS>	<94%>
Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue:
And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
</TITUS>
<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
Go fetch them hither to us presently.
</SATURNINUS>
<TITUS>	<94%>
Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kills Tamora.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<95%>
Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
</SATURNINUS>
<STAGE DIR>

<LUCIUS>	<95%>
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!

<Kills Saturninus. A great tumult. The people in confusion...>
<... disperse. Marcus, Lucius, and their partisans, go up into the balcony.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<95%>
You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
O! let me teach you how to knit again
This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
These broken limbs again into one body,
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
Do shameful execution on herself.
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
Grave witnesses of true experience,
Cannot induce you to attend my words,
<STAGE DIR>
<To Lucius.>
</STAGE DIR> Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
The story of that baleful burning night
When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy;
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
And break my very utterance, even in the time
When it should move you to attend me most,
Lending your kind commiseration.
Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
</MARCUS>
<LUCIUS>	<96%>
Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
And they it was that ravished our sister.
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
And sent her enemies unto the grave:
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears,
And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend:
And I am the turn'd forth, be it known to you,
That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood,
And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
That my report is just and full of truth.
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
Citing my worthless praise: O! pardon me;
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<97%>
Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child;
Of this was Tamora delivered,
The issue of an irreligious Moor,
Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
The villain is alive in Titus' house,
Damn'd as he is, to witness this is true.
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
Or more than any living man could bear.
Now you have heard the truth, what say you Romans?
Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,
And, from the place where you behold us now,
The poor remainder of Andronici
Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down,
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
And make a mutual closure of our house.
Speak, Romans, speak! and if you say we shall,
Lo! hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
</MARCUS>
<ÆMILIUS>	<97%>
Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
Lucius, our emperor; for well I know
The common voice do cry it shall be so.

Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
For nature puts me to a heavy task.
Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near,
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
O! take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses Titus.>
</STAGE DIR>
These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
The last true duties of thy noble son!
</LUCIUS>
<MARCUS>	<98%>
Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
O! were the sum of these that I should pay
Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.
</MARCUS>
<LUCIUS>	<98%>
Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
To melt in showers: thy grandsire lov'd thee well:
Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,
Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
Many a matter hath he told to thee,
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
In that respect, then, like a loving child,
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
Because kind nature doth require it so:
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe.
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
</LUCIUS>
<BOY>	<99%>
O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
Would I were dead, so you did live again.
O Lord! I cannot speak to him for weeping;
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.

Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food:
If any one relieves or pities him,
For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
</LUCIUS>
<AARON>	<99%>
O! why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done.
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform, if I might have my will:
If one good deed in all my life I did,
I do repent it from my very soul.
</AARON>
<LUCIUS>	<99%>
Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
And give him burial in his father's grave.
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Be closed in our household's monument.
As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
No funeral rite, nor man in mournful weeds,
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey.
Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
