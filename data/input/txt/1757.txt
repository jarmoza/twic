Because that you are going
And never coming back
And I, however accurate,
May overlook your track,
Because that Death is Treason
However true it be -
This instant be abolished
To all but Fealty -
Significance, that each has lived
The other to detect -
Discovery, not God himself
Could now annihilate -
Eternity, presumption,
The instant I perceive
That you, who were existence
Yourself forgot to live -
"The Life that is", will then have been
A thing I never knew,
As Paradise, fictitious,
Until the Realm of you.
The "Life that is to be" to me
A Residence too plain
Unless in my Redeemer's Face
I recognize your own -
Of Immortality who doubts
He may exchange with me
Curtailed by your obscuring Face
Of everything but he,
Of Heaven and Hell I also yield
The Right to reprehend
To whoso would commute this Face
For his less priceless Friend -
If "God is Love" as he admits,
We think that he must be
Because he is a jealous God
He tells us certainly -
If "All is possible" with him
As he besides concedes -
He will refund us finally
Our confiscated Gods -
