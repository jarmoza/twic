My Worthiness is all my Doubt --
His Merit -- all my fear --
Contrasting which, my quality
Do lowlier -- appear --
Lest I should insufficient prove
For His beloved Need --
The Chiefest Apprehension
Upon my  thronging Mind --
'Tis true -- that Deity to stoop
Inherently incline --
For nothing higher than Itself
Itself can  rest upon --
So I -- the undivine abode
Of His Elect Content --
Conform my Soul -- as twere a Church,
Unto Her Sacrament --
