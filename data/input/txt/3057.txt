It always felt to me -- a wrong
To that Old Moses -- done --
To let him see -- the Canaan --
Without the entering --
And tho' in soberer moments --
No Moses there can be
I'm satisfied -- the Romance
In point of injury --
Surpasses sharper stated --
Of Stephen -- or of Paul --
For these -- were only put to death --
While God's adroiter will
On Moses -- seemed to fasten
With tantalizing Play
As Boy -- should deal with lesser Boy --
To prove ability.
The fault -- was doubtless Israel's --
Myself -- had banned the Tribes --
And ushered Grand Old Moses
In Pentateuchal Robes
Upon the Broad Possession
'Twas little -- He should see --
Old Man on Nebo! Late as this --
My justice bleeds -- for Thee!
