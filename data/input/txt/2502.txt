Could live -- did live --
Could die -- did die --
Could smile upon the whole
T[h]rough faith in one he met not,
To introduce his soul.
Could go from scene familiar
To an untraversed spot --
Could contemplate the journey
With unpuzzled heart --
Such trust had one among us,
Among us not today --
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay!
