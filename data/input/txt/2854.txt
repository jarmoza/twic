'Twas Love -- not me --
Oh punish -- pray --
The Real one died for Thee --
Just Him -- not me --
Such Guilt -- to love Thee -- most!
Doom it beyond the Rest --
Forgive it -- last --
'Twas base as Jesus -- most!
Let Justice not mistake --
We Two -- looked so alike --
Which was the Guilty Sake --
'Twas Love's -- Now Strike!
