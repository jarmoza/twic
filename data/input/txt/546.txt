I cannot dance opon my Toes -
No Man instructed me -
But oftentimes, among my mind
A Glee possesseth me
That had I -
Would put itself abroad
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe -
Or lay a Prima - mad -
And though I had no Gown of Gauze -
No Ringlet, to my Hair -
Nor hopped to Audiences - like Birds -
One Claw opon the Air -
Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls -
Nor rolled on Wheels of Snow
Till I was out of sight in sound -
The House encore me so -
Nor any know I know the Art
I mention easy - Here -
Nor any Placard boast me
It's full as Opera -
