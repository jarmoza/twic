"Heaven" has different Signs - to me -
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place -
And when again, at Dawn,
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills -
An Awe if it should be like that
Opon the Ignorance steals -
The Orchard, when the Sun is on -
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make -
Some Carnivals of Clouds -
The Rapture of a finished Day
Returning to the West -
All these - remind us of the place
That Men call "Paradise" -
Itself be fairer - we suppose -
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace -
Not yet, our eyes can see -
