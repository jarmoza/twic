He strained my faith -
Did he find it supple?
Shook my strong trust -
Did it then - yield?
Hurled my belief -
But - did he shatter - it?
Racked - with suspense -
Not a nerve failed!
Wrung me - with Anguish -
But I never doubted him -
for what wrong
He did never say -
Stabbed - while I sued
His sweet forgiveness -
Jesus - it's your little "John"!
Dont you know - me?
