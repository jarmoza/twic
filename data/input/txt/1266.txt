Dying! To be afraid of thee
One must to thine Artillery
Have left exposed a Friend -
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot
Delivered straighter to the Heart
The leaving Love behind -
Not for itself, the Dust is shy,
But, enemy, Beloved be
Thy Batteries divorce.
Fight sternly in a Dying eye
Two Armies, Love and Certainty
And Love and the Reverse -
