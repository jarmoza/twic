Because that you are going
And never coming back
And I, however absolute
May overlook your Track -
Because that Death is final,
However first it be
This instant be suspended
Above Mortality.
Significance that each has lived
The other to detect
Discovery not God himself
Could now annihilate
Eternity, Presumption
The instant I perceive
That you, who were Existence
Yourself forgot to live -
The "Life that is" will then have been
A Thing I never knew -
As Paradise fictitious
Until the Realm of you -
The "Life that is to be," to me,
A Residence too plain
Unless in my Redeemer's Face
I recognize your own.
Of Immortality who doubts
He may exchange with me
Curtailed by your obscuring Face
Of Everything but He -
Of Heaven and Hell I also yield
The Right to reprehend
To whoso would commute this Face
For his less priceless Friend.
If "God is Love" as he admits
We think that he must be
Because he is a "jealous God"
He tells us certainly
If "All is possible with" him
As he besides concedes
He will refund us finally
Our confiscated Gods -
