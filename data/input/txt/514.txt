I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there -
I held my spirit to the Glass,
To prove it possibler -
I turned my Being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the Owner's name -
For doubt, that I should know the sound -
I judged my features - jarred my hair -
I pushed my dimples by, and waited -
If they - twinkled back -
Conviction might, of me -
I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend -
That - was a former time -
But we might learn to like the Heaven,
As well as our Old Home"!
