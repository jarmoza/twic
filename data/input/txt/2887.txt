I'll clutch -- and clutch --
Next -- One -- Might be the golden touch --
Could take it --
Diamonds -- Wait --
I'm diving -- just a little late --
But stars -- go slow -- for night --
I'll string you -- in fine Necklace --
Tiaras -- make -- of some --
Wear you on Hem --
Loop up a Countess -- with you --
Make -- a Diadem -- and mend my old One --
Count -- Hoard -- then lose --
And doubt that you are mine --
To have the joy of feeling it -- again --
I'll show you at the Court --
Bear you -- for Ornament
Where Women breathe --
That every sigh -- may lift you
Just as high -- as I --
And -- when I die --
In meek array -- display you --
Still to show -- how rich I go --
Lest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful --
And banish me --
