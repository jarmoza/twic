"Arcturus" is his other name -
I'd rather call him "Star"!
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
I slew a worm the other day,
A "Savan" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam" - "Centipede"!
"Oh Lord, how frail are we"!
I pull a flower from the woods -
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath -
And has her in a "Class"!
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat,
He sits erect in "Cabinets" -
The Clover bells forgot!
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now!
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped, and charted too!
What if the "poles" should frisk about
And stand opon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" -
Whatever prank betides!
Perhaps the "kingdom of Heaven's" changed.
I hope the "Children" there
Wont be "new fashioned" when I come -
And laugh at me - and stare!
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl -
"Old fashioned"! naughty! everything!
Over the stile of "pearl"!
