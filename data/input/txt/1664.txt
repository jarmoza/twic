Risk is the Hair that holds the Tun
Seductive in the Air -
That Tun is hollow - but the Tun -
With Hundred Weights - to spare -
Too ponderous to suspect the snare
Espies that fickle chair
And seats itself to be let go
By that perfidious Hair -
The "foolish Tun" the Critics say -
While that  delusive Hair
Persuasive as Perdition,
Decoys it's Traveller
