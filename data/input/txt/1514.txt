The Bird did prance - the Bee did play -
The Sun ran miles away
So blind with joy he could not choose
Between his Holiday -
The morn was up - the meadows out
The Fences all but ran -
Republic of Delight, I thought
Where each is Citizen -
From Heavy laden Lands to thee
Were seas to cross to come
A Caspian were crowded -
Too near thou art for Fame -
