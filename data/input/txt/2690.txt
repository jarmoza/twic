We -- Bee and I -- live by the quaffing --
'Tis'nt all Hock -- with us --
Life has it's Ale --
But it's many a lay of the Dim Burgundy --
We chant -- for cheer -- when the Wines -- fail --
Do we "get drunk"?
Ask the jolly Clovers!
Do we "beat" our "Wife"?
I -- never wed --
Bee -- pledges his -- in minute flagons --
Dainty -- as the tress -- on her deft Head --
While runs the Rhine --
He and I -- revel --
First -- at the vat -- and latest at the Vine --
Noon -- our last Cup --
"Found dead" -- "of Nectar" --
By a humming Coroner --
In a By-Thyme!
