The Sun kept setting - setting - still
No Hue of Afternoon -
Opon the Village I perceived -
From House to House 'twas Noon -
The Dusk kept dropping - dropping - still
No Dew opon the Grass -
But only on my Forehead stopped -
And wandered in my Face -
My Feet kept drowsing - drowsing - still
My fingers were awake -
Yet why so little sound - Myself
Unto my seeming - make?
How well I knew the Light before -
I could not see it now -
'Tis Dying - I am doing - but
I'm not afraid to know -
