Through the strait pass of suffering -
The Martyrs - even - trod.
Their feet - opon Temptation -
Their faces - opon God -
A stately - shriven - Company -
Convulsion - playing round -
Harmless - as streaks of meteor -
Opon a Planet's Bond -
Their faith - the everlasting troth -
Their expectation - fair -
The Needle - to the North Degree -
Wades - so - thro' polar Air!
