The Child's faith is new --
Whole -- like His Principle --
Wide -- like the Sunrise
On fresh Eyes --
Never had a Doubt --
Laughs -- at a Scruple --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --
Credits the World --
Deems His Dominion
Broadest of Sovreignties --
And Caesar -- mean --
In the Comparison --
Baseless Emperor --
Ruler of Nought,
Yet swaying all --
Grown bye and bye
To hold mistaken
His pretty estimates
Of Prickly Things
He gains the skill
Sorrowful -- as certain --
Men -- to anticipate
Instead of Kings --
