One life of so much consequence!
Yet I - for it - would pay -
My soul's entire income -
In ceaseless - salary -
One Pearl - to me - so signal -
That I would instant dive -
Although - I knew - to take it -
Would cost me - just a life!
The Sea is full - I know it!
That - does not blur my Gem!
It burns - distinct from all the row -
Intact - in Diadem!
The life is thick - I know it!
Yet - not so dense a crowd -
But Monarchs - are perceptible -
Far down the dustiest Road!
