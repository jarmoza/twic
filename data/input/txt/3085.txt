'Twas a long Parting -- but the time
For Interview -- had Come --
Before the Judgment Seat of God --
The last -- and second time
These Fleshless Lovers met --
A Heaven in a Gaze --
A Heaven of Heavens -- the Privilege
Of one another's Eyes --
No Lifetime set -- on Them --
Appareled as the new
Unborn -- except They had beheld --
Born infiniter -- now --
Was Bridal -- e'er like This?
A Paradise -- the Host --
And Cherubim -- and Seraphim --
The unobtrusive Guest --
