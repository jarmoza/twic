<STAGE DIR>
<Scene.—In several parts of the Roman Empire.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ACT 1>
<SCENE 1>
<Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Demetrius and Philo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PHILO>	<0%>
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure; those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front; his captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust. Look! where they come.
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Enter Antony and Cleopatra, with their Trains; Eunuchs fanning her.>
</STAGE DIR>
Take but good note, and you shall see in him
The triple pillar of the world transform'd
</PHILO>
Into a strumpet's fool; behold and see.
<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ATTENDANT>	<1%>
News, my good lord, from Rome.
</ATTENDANT>
<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
Grates me; the sum.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
Nay, hear them, Antony:
Fulvia, perchance, is angry; or, who knows
If the scarce-bearded Cæsar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
How, my love!
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
Perchance! nay, and most like;
You must not stay here longer; your dismission
Is come from Cæsar; therefore hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Cæsar's I would say? both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
Is Cæsar's homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man; the nobleness of life
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
<STAGE DIR>
<Embracing.>
</STAGE DIR>
And such a twain can do 't, in which I bind,
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
We stand up peerless.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<2%>
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
Will be himself.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<2%>
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<2%>
Hear the ambassadors.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<2%>
Fie, wrangling queen!
Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
To weep; whose every passion fully strives
To make itself, in thee, fair and admir'd.
No messenger, but thine; and all alone,
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra, with their Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DEMETRIUS>	<2%>
Is Cæsar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
</DEMETRIUS>
<PHILO>	<2%>
Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.
</PHILO>
<DEMETRIUS>	<2%>
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar, who
Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
</DEMETRIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 1>
<SCENE 2>
<The Same. Another Room.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Charmian, Iras, Alexas, and a Soothsayer.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHARMIAN>	<2%>
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? O! that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands.
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>	<3%>
Soothsayer!
</ALEXAS>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
Your will?
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<ALEXAS>	<3%>
Show him your hand.
</ALEXAS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<3%>
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Good sir, give me good fortune.
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
I make not, but foresee.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Pray then, foresee me one.
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
He means in flesh.
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>	<3%>
No, you shall paint when you are old.
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Wrinkles forbid!
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>	<3%>
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
</ALEXAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Hush!
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
You shall be more beloving than belov'd.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>	<3%>
Nay, hear him.
</ALEXAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all; let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage; find me to marry me with Octavius Cæsar, and companion me with my mistress.
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
Then, belike, my children shall have no names; prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
If every of your wishes had a womb,
And fertile every wish, a million.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>	<4%>
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
</ALEXAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>	<4%>
We'll know all our fortunes.
</ALEXAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<4%>
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be,—drunk to bed.
</ENOBARBUS>
<IRAS>	<4%>
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
E'en as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine.
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>	<4%>
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.
Prithee, tell her but a worky-day fortune.
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<4%>
Your fortunes are alike.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<IRAS>	<4%>
But how? but how? give me particulars.
</IRAS>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<4%>
I have said.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<IRAS>	<4%>
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>	<4%>
Not in my husband's nose.
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
Our worser thoughts heaven mend! Alexas,—come, his fortune, his fortune. O! let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee; and let her die too, and give him a worse; and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>	<4%>
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! for, as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
Amen.
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>	<5%>
Lo, now! if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, but they'd do't!
</ALEXAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
Hush! here comes Antony.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CHARMIAN>	<5%>
Not he; the queen.
</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cleopatra.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
Saw you my lord?
</CLEOPATRA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
No, lady.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
Was he not here?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<5%>
No, madam.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
</CLEOPATRA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
Madam!
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>	<5%>
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
</ALEXAS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony, with a Messenger and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
We will not look upon him; go with us.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Alexas, Iras, Charmian, Soothsayer, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER>	<5%>
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
</MESSENGER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
Against my brother Lucius?
</MARK ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>	<5%>
Ay:
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Cæsar,
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy
Upon the first encounter drave them.
</MESSENGER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
Well, what worst?
</MARK ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>	<5%>
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
</MESSENGER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
When it concerns the fool, or coward. On;
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lay death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.
</MARK ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>	<5%>
Labienus—
This is stiff news—hath, with his Parthian force
Extended Asia; from Euphrates
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia: whilst—
</MESSENGER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
Antony, thou wouldst say,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>	<5%>
O! my lord.
</MESSENGER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue;
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O! then we bring forth weeds
When our quick winds lie still; and our ills told us
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
</MARK ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>	<6%>
At your noble pleasure.
</MESSENGER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
</MARK ANTONY>
<ATTENDANT 1>	<6%>
The man from Sicyon, is there such an one?
</ATTENDANT 1>
<ATTENDANT 2>	<6%>
He stays upon your will.
</ATTENDANT 2>
<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
Or lose myself in dotage.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter another Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
What are you?
<MESSENGER 2>	<6%>
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
</MESSENGER 2>
<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
Where died she?
</MARK ANTONY>
<MESSENGER 2>	<6%>
In Sicyon:
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
Importeth thee to know, this bears.
</MESSENGER 2>
<STAGE DIR>
<Giving a letter.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
Forbear me.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Second Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempts do often hurl from us
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off;
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<6%>
What's your pleasure, sir?
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
I must with haste from hence.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<6%>
Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
I must be gone.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
Under a compelling occasion let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
She is cunning past man's thought.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
Alack! sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
Would I had never seen her!
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
O, sir! you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
Fulvia is dead.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
Sir?
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
Fulvia is dead.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
Fulvia!
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
Dead.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<8%>
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<8%>
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<8%>
No more light answers. Let our officers Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the queen,
And get her leave to part. For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Cæsar, and commands
The empire of the sea; our slippery people—
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past—begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier, whose quality, going on,
The sides o' the world may danger. Much is breeding,
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
To such whose place is under us, requires
Our quick remove from hence.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<8%>
I shall do it.
</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 2>
<SCENE 3>
<The Same. Another Room.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<8%>
Where is he?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<8%>
I did not see him since.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<8%>
See where he is, who's with him, what he does;
I did not send you: if you find him sad,
Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
What should I do I do not?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
In each thing give him way, cross him in nothing.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
In time we hate that which we often fear.
But here comes Antony.
</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
I am sick and sullen.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
Help me away, dear Charmian, I shall fall:
It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
Will not sustain it.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
Now, my dearest queen,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
Pray you, stand further from me.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
What's the matter?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
What says the married woman? You may go:
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here;
I have no power upon you; hers you are.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
The gods best know,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
O! never was there queen
So mightily betray'd; yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
Cleopatra,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Which break themselves in swearing!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
Most sweet queen,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
But bid farewell, and go: when you su'd staying
Then was the time for words; no going then:
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Bliss in our brows bent; none our parts so poor
But was a race of heaven; they are so still,
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
Art turn'd the greatest liar.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
How now, lady!
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<10%>
I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
Hear me, queen:
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile, but my full heart
Remains in use with you. Our Italy
Shines o'er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
Equality of two domestic powers
Breeds scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength,
Are newly grown to love; the condemn'd Pompey,
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
Into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
And quietness, grown aick of rest, would purge
By any desperate change. My more particular,
And that which most with you should safe my going,
Is Fulvia's death.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<10%>
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
She's dead, my queen:
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
The garboils she awak'd; at the last, best,
See when and where she died.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<10%>
O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia's death, how mine receiv'd shall be.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
The purposes I bear, which are or cease
As you shall give the advice. By the fire
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
As thou affect'st.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well;
So Antony loves.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
My precious queen, forbear,
And give true evidence to his love which stands
An honourable trial.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
So Fulvia told me.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her;
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
Like perfect honour.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
You'll heat my blood; no more.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
Now, by my sword,—
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
And target. Still he mends;
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
I'll leave you, lady.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
Courteous lord, one word.
Sir, you and I must part, but that 's not it:
Sir, you and I have lov'd, but there 's not it;
That you know well: something it is I would,—
O! my oblivion is a very Antony,
And I am all forgotten.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
For idleness itself.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
'Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
Since my becomings kill me when they do not
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
Be strew'd before your feet!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
Let us go. Come;
Our separation so abides and flies,
That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
Away!
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 3>
<SCENE 4>
<Rome. A Room in Cæsar's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Octavius Cæsar, Lepidus, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CÆSAR>	<12%>
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
It is not Cæsar's natural vice to hate
Our great competitor. From Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners: you shall find there
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow.
</CÆSAR>
<LEPIDUS>	<12%>
I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness;
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change

<CÆSAR>	<12%>
You are too indulgent. Let us grant it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat; say this becomes him,—
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish,—yet must Antony
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
Call on him for 't; but to confound such time
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
As his own state and ours, 'tis to be chid
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel to judgment.

<LEPIDUS>	<13%>
Here's more news.
</LEPIDUS>
<MESSENGER>	<13%>
Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
Most noble Cæsar, shalt thou have report
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
And it appears he is belov'd of those
That only have fear'd Cæsar; to the ports
The discontents repair, and men's reports
Give him much wrong'd.
</MESSENGER>
<CÆSAR>	<13%>
I should have known no less.
It hath been taught us from the primal state,
That he which is was wish'd until he were;
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
To rot itself with motion.
</CÆSAR>
<MESSENGER>	<13%>
Cæsar, I bring thee word,
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt;
No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.
</MESSENGER>
<CÆSAR>	<13%>
Antony,
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Than savages could suffer; thou didst drink
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
Which some did die to look on; and all this—
It wounds thy honour that I speak it now—
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
So much as lank'd not.
</CÆSAR>
<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
'Tis pity of him.
</LEPIDUS>
<CÆSAR>	<14%>
Let his shames quickly
Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
Assemble me immediate council; Pompey
Thrives in our idleness.
</CÆSAR>
<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
To-morrow, Cæsar,
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.
</LEPIDUS>
<CÆSAR>	<14%>
Till which encounter,
It is my business too. Farewell.

Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime

Yes, gracious madam.

Yet have I fierce affections, and think

<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
O Charmian!
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phœbus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Cæsar,
When thou wast here above the ground I was
A morsel for a monarch, and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life.

Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>	<15%>
Last thing he did, dear queen,
He kiss'd, the last of many doubled kisses,
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>	<15%>
'Good friend,' quoth he,
'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumb'd by him.
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
What! was he sad or merry?
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>	<16%>
Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
He was not sad, for he would shire on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man else. Mett'st thou my posts?
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>	<16%>
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony,
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Cæsar so?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<16%>
O! that brave Cæsar.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
Be chok'd with such another emphasis!

By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
If thou with Cæsar paragon again
My man of men.

By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>

Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays

We, ignorant of ourselves,
Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.
</MENECRATES>
<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
I shall do well:
The people love me, and the sea is mine;
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
No wars without doors; Cæsar gets money where
He loses hearts; Lepidus flatters both,
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
Nor either cares for him.

From Silvius, sir.
</MENAS>
<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
He dreams; I know they are in Rome together,
Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
Sharpen with cloyless sance his appetite,
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
Even till a Lethe'd dulness!

This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Expected; since he went from Egypt 'tis
A space for further travel.
</VARRIUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<18%>
I could have given less matter
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
For such a petty war; his soldiership
Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
The higher our opinion, that our stirring
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
</POMPEIUS>
<MENAS>	<18%>
I cannot hope
Cæsar and Antony shall well greet together;
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Cæsar,
His brother warr'd upon him, although I think
Not mov'd by Antony.
</MENAS>
<POMPEIUS>	<18%>
I know not, Menas,
How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
Were 't not that we stand up against them all
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords; but how the fear of us
May cement their divisions and bind up
The petty difference, we yet not know.
Be it as our gods will have 't! It only stands
Our lives upon, to use our strongest hands.
Come, Menas.

Let Antony look over Cæsar's head,

Noble friends,
That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
May it be gently heard; when we debate
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
Murder in healing wounds; then, noble partners,—
The rather for I earnestly beseech,—
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
Nor curstness grow to the matter.
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
'Tis spoken well.
Were we before our armies, and to fight,
I should do thus.
</MARK ANTONY>

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
Thank you.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<19%>
Sit.

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
Sit, sir.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<19%>
Nay, then.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
Or being, concern you not.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<19%>
I must be laugh'd at
If, or for nothing or a little, I
Should say myself offended, and with you
Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
It not concern'd me.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
My being in Egypt, Cæsar,
What was 't to you?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<19%>
No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt; yet, if you there
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
Might be my question.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
How intend you, practis'd?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<20%>
You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me, and their contestation
Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
You do mistake your business; my brother never
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
And have my learning from some true reports,
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours,
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
As matter whole you n' have to make it with,
It must not be with this.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<20%>
You praise yourself
By laying defects of judgment to me, but
You patch'd up your excuses.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
Not so, not so;
I know you could not lack, I am certain on 't,
Very necessity of this thought, that I,
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
I would you had her spirit in such another:
The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<20%>
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Cæsar,
Made out of her impatience,—which not wanted
Shrewdness of policy too,—I grieving grant
Did you too much disquiet; for that you must
But say I could not help it.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<21%>
I wrote to you
When rioting in Alexandria; you
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
Did gibe my missive out of audience.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<21%>
Sir,
He fell upon me, ere admitted: then
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
Of what I was i' the morning; but next day
I told him of myself, which was as much
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
Out of our question wipe him.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<21%>
You have broken
The article of your oath, which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with.
</CÆSAR>
<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
Soft, Cæsar!
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<21%>
No,
Lepidus, let him speak:
The honour's sacred which he talks on now,
Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Cæsar;
The article of my oath.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<21%>
To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
The which you both denied.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<21%>
Neglected, rather;
And then, when poison'd hours had bound me up
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
To stoop in such a case.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
'Tis noble spoken.
</LEPIDUS>
<MECÆNAS>	<21%>
If it might please you, to enforce no further
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
Were to remember that the present need
Speaks to atone you.
</MECÆNAS>
<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
Worthily spoken, Mecænas.
</LEPIDUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<21%>
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
Thou art a soldier only; speak no more.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<22%>
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<22%>
Go to, then; your considerate stone.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CÆSAR>	<22%>
I do not much dislike the matter, but
The manner of his speech; for it cannot be
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
So differing in their acts. Yet, if I knew
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
O' the world I would pursue it.
</CÆSAR>
<AGRIPPA>	<22%>
Give me leave, Cæsar.
</AGRIPPA>
<CÆSAR>	<22%>
Speak, Agrippa.
</CÆSAR>
<AGRIPPA>	<22%>
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
Admir'd Octavia; great Mark Antony
Is now a widower.
</AGRIPPA>
<CÆSAR>	<22%>
Say not so, Agrippa:
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
Were well deserv'd of rashness.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
I am not married, Cæsar; let me hear
Agrippa further speak.
</MARK ANTONY>
<AGRIPPA>	<22%>
To hold you in perpetual amity,
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping knot, take Antony
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men,
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
All little jealousies which now seem great,
And all great fears which now import their dangers,
Would then be nothing; truths would be but tales
Where now half tales be truths; her love to both
Would each to other and all loves to both
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
By duty ruminated.
</AGRIPPA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
Will Cæsar speak?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<22%>
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
With what is spoke already.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
What power is in Agrippa,
If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
To make this good?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<23%>
The power of Cæsar, and
His power unto Octavia.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
May I never
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand;
Further this act of grace, and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs!
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<23%>
There is my hand.
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly; let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never
Fly off our loves again!
</CÆSAR>
<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
Happily, amen!
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me; I must thank him only,
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
At heel of that, defy him.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
Time calls upon 's:
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Or else he seeks out us.
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
Where lies he?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<23%>
About the Mount Misenum.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
What's his strength
By land?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<23%>
Great and increasing; but by sea
He is an absolute master.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
So is the fame.
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it;
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
The business we have talk'd of.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<23%>
With most gladness;
And do invite you to my sister's view,
Whither straight I'll lead you.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>

</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<24%>
Good Enobarbus!
</AGRIPPA>
<MECÆNAS>	<24%>
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by 't in
Egypt.
</MECÆNAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night light with drinking.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECÆNAS>	<24%>
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there; is this true?
</MECÆNAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
This was but as a fly by an eagle; we had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECÆNAS>	<24%>
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
</MECÆNAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<24%>
There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold,
Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that
The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description; she did lie
In her pavilion,—cloth-of-gold of tissue,—
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature; on each side her
Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<24%>
O! rare for Antony.
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
And made their bends adornings; at the helm
A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her, and Antony,
Enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
And made a gap in nature.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<25%>
Rare Egyptian!
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper; she replied
It should be better he became her guest,
Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And, for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<25%>
Royal wench!
She made great Cæsar lay his sword to bed;
He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted
That she did make defect perfection,
And, breathless, power breathe forth.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECÆNAS>	<25%>
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
</MECÆNAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
Never; he will not:
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety; other women cloy
The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECÆNAS>	<25%>
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
The heart of Antony, Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him.
</MECÆNAS>
<AGRIPPA>	<25%>
Let us go.
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
Whilst you abide here.

Humbly, sir, I thank you.

All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.

<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
Good night, sir. My Octavia,
Read not my blemishes in the world's report;
I have not kept my square, but that to come
Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.

Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?

Thither!
</SOOTHSAYER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
If you can, your reason?

<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
I see it in
My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
Hie you to Egypt again.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
Say to me,
Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Cæsar's or mine?
</MARK ANTONY>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
Cæsar's.
Therefore, O Antony! stay not by his side;
Thy demon—that's thy spirit which keeps thee,—is
Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
Where Cæsar's is not; but near him thy angel
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd; therefore
Make space enough between you.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
Speak this no more.
</MARK ANTONY>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
If thou dost play with him at any game
Thou art sure to lose, and, of that natural luck,
He beats thee 'gainst the odds; thy lustre thickens
When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him,
But he away, 'tis noble.
</SOOTHSAYER>
<MARK ANTONY>	<27%>
Get thee gone:
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Soothsayer.>
</STAGE DIR>
He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap
He hath spoken true; the very dice obey him.
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance; if we draw lots he speeds,
His cocks do win the battle still of mine
When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
I' the east my pleasure lies.

My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

As well a woman with a eunuch play'd
As with a woman. Come, you 'll play with me, sir?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARDIAN>	<28%>
As well as I can, madam.
</MARDIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
The actor may plead pardon. I 'll none now.
Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there—
My music playing far off—I will betray
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
I'll think them every one an Antony,
And say, 'Ah, ha!' you're caught.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<28%>
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
That time—O times!—
I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
I laugh'd him into patience: and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
O! from Italy;
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
</CLEOPATRA>
That long time have been barren.
<MESSENGER>	<28%>
Madam, madam,—
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
Antony's dead! if thou say so, villain,
Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<28%>
First, madam, he is well.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
Why, there's more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
The gold I give thee will I melt, and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
Good madam, hear me.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
Well, go to, I will;
But there's no goodness in thy face; if Antony
Be free and healthful, so tart a favour
To trumpet such good tidings! if not well,
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
Not like a formal man.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
Will't please you hear me?
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Cæsar, or not captive to him,
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
Madam, he's well.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
Well said.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
And friends with Cæsar.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
Thou'rt an honest man.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
Cæsar and he are greater friends than ever.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
Make thee a fortune from me.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
But yet, madam,—
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
I do not like 'but yet,' it does allay
The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet!'
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together. He's friends with Cæsar;
In state of health, thou sayst; and thou sayst, free.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
He's bound unto Octavia.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
For what good turn?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
For the best turn i' the bed.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
I am pale, Charmian!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
Madam, he's married to Octavia.

<STAGE DIR>
<Strikes him again.>
</STAGE DIR>
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
<STAGE DIR>
<She hales him up and down.>

Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
Smarting in lingering pickle.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<30%>
Gracious madam,
I, that do bring the news made not the match.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud; the blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<30%>
He's married, madam.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
Rogue! thou hast liv'd too long.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Draws a knife.>

<MESSENGER>	<30%>
Nay, then I'll run.
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
</MESSENGER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHARMIAN>	<30%>
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself;
The man is innocent.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<30%>
He is afeard to come.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
I will not hurt him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Charmian.>
</STAGE DIR>
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
A meaner than myself; since I myself
Have given myself the cause.
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Charmian, and Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
Come hither, sir.
Though it be honest, it is never good
To bring bad news; give to a gracious message
A host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell
</CLEOPATRA>
Themselves when they be felt.
<MESSENGER>	<31%>
I have done my duty.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
If thou again say 'Yes.'
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<31%>
He's married, madam.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<31%>
Should I lie, madam?
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
O! I would thou didst,
So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
A cistern for scal'd snakes. Go, get thee hence;
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<31%>
I crave your highness' pardon.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
He is married?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<31%>
Take no offence that I would not offend you;
To punish me for what you make me do
Seems much unequal; he's married to Octavia.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
O! that his fault should make a knave of thee,
That art not what thou'rt sure of. Get thee hence;
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me; lie they upon thy hand
And be undone by 'em!
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHARMIAN>	<31%>
Good your highness, patience.

In praising Antony I have disprais'd Cæsar.

<CHARMIAN>	<31%>
Many times, madam.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
I am paid for 't now.
Lead me from hence;
I faint. O Iras! Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
Her inclination, let him not leave out
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>
Let him forever go:—let him not—Charmian!—
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
The other way's a Mars. <STAGE DIR>

Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
And we shall talk before we fight.
</POMPEIUS>
<CÆSAR>	<32%>
Most meet
That first we come to words, and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent;
Which if thou hast consider'd, let us know
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.
</CÆSAR>
<POMPEIUS>	<32%>
To you all three,
The senators alone of this great world,
Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
Wherefore my father should revengers want,
Having a son and friends; since Julius Cæsar,
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
There saw you labouring for him. What was 't
That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
To drench the Capitol, but that they would
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
The anger'd ocean foams, with which I meant
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.
</POMPEIUS>
<CÆSAR>	<32%>
Take your time.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<32%>
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
We 'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
How much we do o'er-count thee.
</MARK ANTONY>
<POMPEIUS>	<32%>
At land, indeed,
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house;
But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
Remain in 't as thou mayst.
</POMPEIUS>
<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
Be pleas'd to tell us—
For this is from the present—how you take
The offers we have sent you.
</LEPIDUS>
<CÆSAR>	<33%>
There's the point.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
What it is worth embrac'd.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<33%>
And what may follow,
To try a larger fortune.
</CÆSAR>
<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
Our targets undinted.
</POMPEIUS>
<CÆSAR>	<33%>
That's our offer.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
That's our offer.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
That's our offer.
</LEPIDUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepar'd
To take this offer; but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Cæsar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.
</POMPEIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
I have heard it, Pompey;
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.
</MARK ANTONY>
<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
Let me have your hand:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
</POMPEIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither,
For I have gain'd by 't.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<33%>
Since I saw you last,
There is a change upon you.
</CÆSAR>
<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
Well, I know not
What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal.
</POMPEIUS>
<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
Well met here.
</LEPIDUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
I crave our composition may be written
And seal'd between us.
</POMPEIUS>
<CÆSAR>	<34%>
That 's the next to do.
</CÆSAR>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.
</POMPEIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
That will I, Pompey.
</MARK ANTONY>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
No, Antony, take the lot:
But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Cæsar
Grew fat with feasting there.
</POMPEIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
You have heard much.
</MARK ANTONY>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
I have fair meanings, sir.
</POMPEIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
And fair words to them.
</MARK ANTONY>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
Then, so much have I heard;
And I have heard Apollodorus carried—
</POMPEIUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
No more of that: he did so.
</ENOBARBUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
What, I pray you?
</POMPEIUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
A certain queen to Cæsar in a mattress.
</ENOBARBUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
I know thee now; how far'st thou, soldier?
</POMPEIUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
Well;
And well am like to do; for I perceive
Four feasts are toward.
</ENOBARBUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
Let me shake thy hand;
I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behaviour.
</POMPEIUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
Sir,
I never lov'd you much, but I ha' prais'd ye
When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
As I have said you did.
</ENOBARBUS>
<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
Enjoy thy plainness,
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?
</POMPEIUS>
<CÆSAR>	<34%>
Show us the way, sir.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
Show us the way, sir.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<34%>
Show us the way, sir.
</LEPIDUS>

Come.
</POMPEIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all except Menas and Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MENAS>	<34%>
Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty. You and I have known, sir.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
At sea, I think.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<34%>
We have, sir.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
You have done well by water.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<34%>
And you by land.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
Nor what I have done by water.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety; you have been a great thief by sea.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
And you by land.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
All men's faces are true, whatsoe'er their hands are.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
No slander; they steal hearts.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
We came hither to fight with you.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
If he do, sure, he cannot weep it back again.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
You have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
Cæsar's sister is called Octavia.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
Pray ye, sir?
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
'Tis true.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
Then is Cæsar and he for ever knit together.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
I think so too; but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<35%>
Who would not have his wife so?
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then, shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Cæsar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>	<36%>
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<36%>

Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already; the least wind i' the world will blow them down.

<SERVANT 2>	<36%>
Lepidus is high-coloured.
</SERVANT 2>
<SERVANT 1>	<36%>
They have made him drink alms-drink.
</SERVANT 1>
<SERVANT 2>	<36%>
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out, 'No more;' reconciles them to his entreaty, and himself to the drink.
</SERVANT 2>
<SERVANT 1>	<36%>
But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
</SERVANT 1>
<SERVANT 2>	<36%>
Why, this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship; I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.

To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

Thus do they, sir. They take the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
You've strange serpents there.
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
Ay, Lepidus.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.

They are so.

<ENOBARBUS>	<37%>
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things; without contradiction, I have heard that.

Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,
And bear me speak a word.

Forbear me till anon.
This wine for Lepidus!
</POMPEIUS>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs; it lives by that which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
What colour is it of?
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
Of it own colour too.
</MARK ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
'Tis a strange serpent.
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
'Tis so; and the tears of it are wet.

Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That 's twice.

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
How should that be?

<MENAS>	<38%>
But entertain it,
And though thou think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.
</MENAS>
<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
Hast thou drunk well?
</POMPEIUS>
<MENAS>	<38%>
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove:
Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
Is thine, if thou wilt ha 't.

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
Show me which way.
</POMPEIUS>
<MENAS>	<38%>
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
All there is thine.
</MENAS>
<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
Ah! this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on 't. In me 'tis villany;
In thee 't had been good service. Thou must know
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
Mine honour it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
Hath so betray'd thine act; being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done,
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
</POMPEIUS>
<MENAS>	<38%>

I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,

Let me request you off; our graver business

Splits what it speaks; the wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.

<... Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of Pacorus borne before him.>
</STAGE DIR>
<VENTIDIUS>	<40%>
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
</VENTIDIUS>
<SILIUS>	<41%>
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly; so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.
</SILIUS>
<VENTIDIUS>	<41%>
O Silius, Silius!
I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius,
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Cæsar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person; Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achiev'd by the minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.
</VENTIDIUS>
<SILIUS>	<41%>
Thou hast, Ventidius, that
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?
</SILIUS>
<VENTIDIUS>	<41%>
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' the field.
</VENTIDIUS>
<SILIUS>	<41%>
Where is he now?
</SILIUS>
<VENTIDIUS>	<41%>
He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with 's will permit,
We shall appear before him. On, there; pass along.

They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Cæsar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
'Tis a noble Lepidus.
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
A very fine one. O! how he loves Cæsar.

Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
Cæsar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
Would you praise Cæsar, say, 'Cæsar,' go no further.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
But he loves Cæsar best; yet he loves Antony.
Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number; hoo!
His love to Antony. But as for Cæsar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
Both he loves.

You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my furthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<43%>
Make me not offended
In your distrust.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CÆSAR>	<43%>
I have said.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<43%>
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear. So, the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.

Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:

He were the worse for that were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>	<43%>
Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Cæsar dead
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<43%>
That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe 't, till I wept too.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CÆSAR>	<44%>
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.
</CÆSAR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<44%>
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.

Madam, in Rome;
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

Is she as tall as me?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<44%>
She is not, madam.

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongu'd, or low?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<44%>
Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voic'd.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

<CHARMIAN>	<44%>
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<45%>
She creeps;
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.
</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
Is this certain?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MESSENGER>	<45%>
Or I have no observance.

For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?

Brown, madam; and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.

Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,
That were excusable, that, and thousands more
Of semblable import, but he hath wag'd
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
To public ear:
Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me;
When the best hint was given him, he not took 't,
Or did it from his teeth.
</MARK ANTONY>
<OCTAVIA>	<46%>
O my good lord!
Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
Praying for both parts:
The good gods will mock me presently,
When I shall pray, 'O! bless my lord and husband;'
Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
'O! bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
'Twixt these extremes at all.
</OCTAVIA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<46%>
Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour
I lose myself; better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
Yourself shall go between's; the mean time, lady,
I'll raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother; make your soonest haste,
So your desires are yours.
</MARK ANTONY>
<OCTAVIA>	<46%>
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
Should solder up the rift.
</OCTAVIA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<47%>
When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way; for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
Choose your own company, and command what cost
Your heart has mind to.

<EROS>	<47%>
There's strange news come, sir.
</EROS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
What, man?
</ENOBARBUS>
<EROS>	<47%>
Cæsar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
</EROS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
This is old: what is the success?
</ENOBARBUS>
<EROS>	<47%>
Cæsar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
</EROS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
</ENOBARBUS>
<EROS>	<47%>
He's walking in the garden—thus: and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool, Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murder'd Pompey.
</EROS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
Our great navy's rigg'd.
</ENOBARBUS>

For Italy and Cæsar. More, Domitius;
My lord desires you presently: my news
I might have told hereafter.

But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

<Rome. A Room in Cæsar's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cæsar, Agrippa, and Mecænas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CÆSAR>	<48%>
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
In Alexandria; here's the manner of 't;
I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
Cæsarion, whom they call my father's son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the 'stablishment of Egypt; made her
Of Lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute queen.
</CÆSAR>
<MECÆNAS>	<48%>
This in the public eye?
</MECÆNAS>
<CÆSAR>	<48%>
I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings;
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria, Cilicia, and Phœnicia. She
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
As 'tis reported, so.
</CÆSAR>
<MECÆNAS>	<48%>
Let Rome be thus
Informed.
</MECÆNAS>
<AGRIPPA>	<48%>
Who, queasy with his insolence
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
</AGRIPPA>
<CÆSAR>	<48%>
The people know it; and have now receiv'd
His accusations.
</CÆSAR>
<AGRIPPA>	<48%>
Whom does he accuse?
</AGRIPPA>
<CÆSAR>	<48%>
Cæsar; and that, having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
His part o' the isle; then does he say, he lent me
Some shipping unrestor'd; lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.
</CÆSAR>
<AGRIPPA>	<48%>
Sir, this should be answer'd.
</AGRIPPA>
<CÆSAR>	<48%>
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
That he his high authority abus'd,
And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
Demand the like.
</CÆSAR>
<MECÆNAS>	<49%>
He'll never yield to that.
</MECÆNAS>
<CÆSAR>	<49%>
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Octavia, with her Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
Hail, Cæsar, and my lord! hail, most dear Cæsar!
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<49%>
That ever I should call thee cast-away!
</CÆSAR>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<49%>
Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
Like Cæsar's sister; the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
Is often left unlov'd: we should have met you
By sea and land, supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.
</CÆSAR>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
Good my lord,
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
On my free-will. My lord, Mark Antony,
Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
His pardon for return.
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<49%>
Which soon he granted,
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
</CÆSAR>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
Do not say so, my lord.
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<49%>
I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?
</CÆSAR>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
My lord, in Athens.
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<49%>
No, my most wrong'd sister; Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore; who now are levying
The kings o' the earth for war. He hath assembled
Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus,
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amintas,
The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
With a more larger list of sceptres.
</CÆSAR>
<OCTAVIA>	<50%>
Ay me, most wretched,
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
That do afflict each other!
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<50%>
Welcome hither:
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
O'er your content these strong necessities,
But let determin'd things to destiny
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
To do you justice, make their ministers
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
And ever welcome to us.
</CÆSAR>
<AGRIPPA>	<50%>
Welcome, lady.
</AGRIPPA>
<MECÆNAS>	<50%>
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
Only the adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off,
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
That noises it against us.
</MECÆNAS>
<OCTAVIA>	<50%>
Is it so, sir?
</OCTAVIA>
<CÆSAR>	<50%>
Most certain. Sister, welcome; pray you,
Be ever known to patience; my dearest sister!

Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,

</STAGE DIR> Well, I could reply:
If we should serve with horse and mares together,
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
A soldier and his horse.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
What is 't you say?
</CLEOPATRA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<51%>
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart, take from his brain, from 's time,
What should not then be spar'd. He is already
Traduc'd for levity, and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus a eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;
I will not stay behind.

Nay, I have done.
Here comes the emperor.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony and Canidius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<51%>
Is it not strange, Canidius,
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
And take in Toryne? You have heard on 't, sweet?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
Celerity is never more admir'd
Than by the negligent.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<51%>
A good rebuke,
Which might have well becom'd the best of men,
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
Will fight with him by sea.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
By sea! What else?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CANIDIUS>	<51%>
Why will my lord do so?
</CANIDIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<51%>
For that he dares us to 't.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<52%>
So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CANIDIUS>	<52%>
Ay, and to wage his battle at Pharsalia,
Where Cæsar fought with Pompey; but these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
And so should you.
</CANIDIUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<52%>
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Cæsar's fleet
Are those that often have gainst Pompey fought:
Their ships are yare; yours, heavy. No disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepar'd for land.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<52%>
By sea, by sea.
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<52%>
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army, which doth most consist
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
From firm security.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<52%>
I'll fight at sea.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<52%>
I have sixty sails, Cæsar none better.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<52%>
Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
And with the rest, full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
Beat the approaching Cæsar. But if we fail,
We then can do 't at land.
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOLDIER>	<52%>
O noble emperor! do not fight by sea;
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt

And the Phœnicians go a-ducking; we
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
And fighting foot to foot.

Not in the power on 't: so our leader's led,
And we are women's men.
</CANIDIUS>
<SOLDIER>	<53%>
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
</SOLDIER>
<CANIDIUS>	<53%>
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,

But we keep whole by land. This speed of Cæsar's

On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,
Whom leprosy o'ertake! i' the midst o' the fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sails and flies.

Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
Endure a further view.

She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Clapson his sea-wing, and like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.

Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.

My very hairs do mutiny, for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
Which leaves itself; to the sea-side straightway;

Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.

Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
And leave his navy gazing.
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<59%>
Prithee, peace.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony, with Euphronius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<59%>
Is that his answer?
</MARK ANTONY>
<EUPHRONIUS>	<59%>
Ay, my lord.
</EUPHRONIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<59%>
The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up?
</MARK ANTONY>
<EUPHRONIUS>	<59%>
He says so.
</EUPHRONIUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<59%>
Let her know't.
To the boy Cæsar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<59%>
That head, my lord?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<59%>
To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him, from which the world should note
Something particular; his coin, ships, legions,
May be a coward's, whose ministers would prevail
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' the command of Cæsar: I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart,
And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Antony and Euphronius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<59%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Yes, like enough, high-battled Cæsar will
Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to the show
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them,
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
Knowing all measures, the full Cæsar will
Answer his emptiness! Cæsar, thou hast subdu'd
His judgment too.
</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ATTENDANT>	<60%>
A messenger from Cæsar.
</ATTENDANT>
<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
What! no more ceremony? See! my women;
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose,
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<60%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Mine honesty and I begin to square.
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly; yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord,
Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
And earns a place i' the story.
</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Thyreus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
Cæsar's will?
</CLEOPATRA>
<THYREUS>	<60%>
Hear it apart.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
None but friends; say boldly.
</CLEOPATRA>
<THYREUS>	<60%>
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
</THYREUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<60%>
He needs as many, sir, as Cæsar has,
Or needs not us. If Cæsar please, our master
Will leap to be his friend; for us, you know
Whose he is we are, and that is Cæsar's.
</ENOBARBUS>
<THYREUS>	<60%>
So.
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Cæsar entreats,
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
Further than he is Cæsar.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
Go on; right royal.
</CLEOPATRA>
<THYREUS>	<60%>
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
O!
</CLEOPATRA>
<THYREUS>	<60%>
The scars upon your honour therefore he
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
Not as deserv'd.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
He is a god, and knows
What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
But conquer'd merely.
</CLEOPATRA>
<ENOBARBUS>	<61%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> To be sure of that,
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou'rt so leaky,
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
Thy dearest quit thee.
</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<THYREUS>	<61%>
Shall I say to Cæsar
What you require of him? for he partly begs
To be desir'd to give. It much would please him,
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon; but it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put yourself under his shroud,
The universal landlord.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<61%>
What's your name?
</CLEOPATRA>
<THYREUS>	<61%>
My name is Thyreus.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<61%>
Most kind messenger,
Say to great Cæsar this: in deputation
I kiss his conqu'ring hand; tell him, I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel;
Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.
</CLEOPATRA>
<THYREUS>	<61%>
'Tis your noblest course.
Wisdom and fortune combating together,
If that the former dare but what it can,
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand.
</THYREUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<61%>
Your Cæsar's father oft,
When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
As it rain'd kisses.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Antony and Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<61%>
Favours, by Jove that thunders!
What art thou, fellow?
</MARK ANTONY>
<THYREUS>	<61%>
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
To have command obey'd.
</THYREUS>
<ENOBARBUS>	<61%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> You will be whipp'd.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<61%>
Approach there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods and devils!
Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
And cry, 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
Antony yet.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
Take hence this Jack and whip him.
<ENOBARBUS>	<62%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
Than with an old one dying.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<62%>
Moon and stars!
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Cæsar, should I find them
So saucy with the hand of—she here, what's her name,
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face
And whine aloud for mercy; take him hence.
</MARK ANTONY>
<THYREUS>	<62%>
Mark Antony,—
</THYREUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<62%>
Tug him away; being whipp'd,
Bring him again; this Jack of Cæsar's shall
Bear us an errand to him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Attendants with Thyreus.>
</STAGE DIR>
You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
By one that looks on feeders?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<62%>
Good my lord,—
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<62%>
You have been a boggler ever:
But when we in our viciousness grow hard,—
O misery on 't!—the wise gods seel our eyes;
In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
Adore our errors; laugh at 's while we strut
To our confusion.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<62%>
O! is't come to this?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<62%>
I found you as a morsel, cold upon
Dead Cæsar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
Luxuriously pick'd out; for, I am sure,
Though you can guess what temperance should be,
You know not what it is.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<63%>
Wherefore is this?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<63%>
To let a fellow that will take rewards
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
And plighter of high hearts. O! that I were
Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
The horned herd; for I have savage cause;
And to proclaim it civilly were like
A halter'd neck, which does the hangman thank
For being yare about him.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Attendants, with Thyreus.>
</STAGE DIR>
Is he whipp'd?
<ATTENDANT 1>	<63%>
Soundly, my lord.
</ATTENDANT 1>
<MARK ANTONY>	<63%>
Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
</MARK ANTONY>
<ATTENDANT 1>	<63%>
He did ask favour.
</ATTENDANT 1>
<MARK ANTONY>	<63%>
If that thy father live, let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
To follow Cæsar in his triumph, since
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth,
The white hand of a lady fever thee,
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Cæsar,
Tell him thy entertainment; look, thou say
He makes me angry with him; for he seems
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't,
When my good stars, that were my former guides,
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
My speech and what is done, tell him he has
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
Hence with thy stripes; be gone!
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Thyreus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<63%>
Have you done yet?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<64%>
Alack! our terrene moon
Is now eclips'd; and it portends alone
The fall of Antony.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<64%>
I must stay his time.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<64%>
To flatter Cæsar, would you mingle eyes
With one that ties his points?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<64%>
Not know me yet?
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<64%>
Cold-hearted toward me?
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<64%>
Ah! dear, if I be so,
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
And poison it in the source; and the first stone
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
Dissolve my life. The next Cæsarion smite,
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
Together with my brave Egyptians all,
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<64%>
I am satisfied.
Cæsar sits down in Alexandria, where
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
There's hope in 't yet.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<64%>
That's my brave lord!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<64%>
I will betreble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
And fight maliciously; for when mine hours
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
Let's mock the midnight bell.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<64%>
It is my birth-day:
I had thought to have held it poor; but, since my lord
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<65%>
We will yet do well.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<65%>
Call all his noble captains to my lord.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<65%>
Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
There's sap in 't yet. The next time I do fight
I'll make death love me, for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all but Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<65%>
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
A diminution in our captain's brain
Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
Some way to leave him.

<CÆSAR>	<65%>
He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
Cæsar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die; meantime
Laugh at his challenge.
</CÆSAR>
<MECÆNAS>	<65%>
Cæsar must think,
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction: never anger
Made good guard for itself.
</MECÆNAS>
<CÆSAR>	<65%>
Let our best heads
Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight. Within our files there are,
Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late,
Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
And feast the army; we have store to do 't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<67%>
Tend me to-night;
May be it is the period of your duty:
Haply, you shall not see me more; or if,
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
You'll serve another master. I look on you
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
I turn you not away; but, like a master
Married to your good service, stay till death.
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
And the gods yield you for 't!
</MARK ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>	<67%>
What mean you, sir,
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd: for shame,
Transform us not to women.
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<67%>
Ho, ho, ho!
Now, the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
You take me in too dolorous a sense,
For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
And drown consideration.

Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Cæsar,

No honourable trust. I have done ill,
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely

I give it you.

Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do 't, I feel.

Some ditch, wherein to die; the foul'st best fits

Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
Destroy'd in such a shape.

I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phœbus' car. Give me thy hand:
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city's ear,

O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,

And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony!

Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou

Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,

O sun! thy uprise shall I see no more;
Fortune and Antony part here; even here

That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
On blossoming Cæsar; and this pine is bark'd,
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,
Whose eyes beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home,
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.

And blemish Cæsar's triumph. Let him take thee,
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
With her prepared nails.

Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
Under this plot; she dies for 't. Eros, ho!

Ay, noble lord.

<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendant rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
With trees upon 't, that nod unto the world
And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.
</MARK ANTONY>
<EROS>	<78%>
Ay, my lord.
</EROS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
That which is now a horse, even with a thought
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
As water is in water.
</MARK ANTONY>
<EROS>	<78%>
It does, my lord.
</EROS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
My good knave, Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body: here I am Antony;
Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
I made these wars for Egypt; and the queen,
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto 't
A million more, now lost; she, Eros, has
Pack'd cards with Cæsar, and false-play'd my glory
Unto an enemy's triumph.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mardian.>

O! thy vile lady;

No, Antony;
My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
With thine entirely.
</MARDIAN>
<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
</MARK ANTONY>
<MARDIAN>	<78%>
Death of one person can be paid but once,
And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand; the last she spake
Was, 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony; it was divided
Between her heart and lips. She render'd life,
Thy name so buried in her.
</MARDIAN>
<MARK ANTONY>	<79%>
Dead, then?
</MARK ANTONY>
<MARDIAN>	<79%>

Does pay thy labour richly; go.

<Exit Mardian.>

Off, pluck off:
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart. O! cleave, my sides;
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
No more a soldier; bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Eros.>

I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
All length is torture; since the torch is out,
Lie down, and stray no further. Now all labour
Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
Itself with strength; seal then, and all is done.
Eros!—I come, my queen.—Eros!—Stay for me:
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze;
Dido and her Æneas shall want troops,
And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros! Eros!

What would my lord?

Since Cleopatra died,
I have liv'd in such dishonour, that the gods
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she, which by her death our Cæsar tells
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
That, when the exigent should come,—which now
Is come indeed,—when I should see behind me
The inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
Thou then wouldst kill me: do 't; the time is come.
Thou strik'st not me, 'tis Cæsar thou defeat'st.
Put colour in thy cheek.
</MARK ANTONY>

The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim and could not?

Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome, and see
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
Of fortunate Cæsar, drawn before him, branded
His baseness that ensu'd?
</MARK ANTONY>
<EROS>	<80%>
I would not see't.

<MARK ANTONY>	<80%>
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country.
</MARK ANTONY>
<EROS>	<80%>
O, sir! pardon me.
</EROS>
<MARK ANTONY>	<80%>
When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.

Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent

Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
Help, friends below! let's draw him hither.

<MARK ANTONY>	<83%>
Peace!
Not Cæsar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<83%>
So it should be, that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<83%>
I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
I here importune death awhile, until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<83%>
I dare not, dear,—
Dear my lord, pardon,—I dare not,
Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
Of the full-fortun'd Cæsar ever shall
Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs, serpents, have
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,—
Help me, my women,—we must draw thee up.
Assist, good friends.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<83%>
O! quick, or I am gone.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<83%>
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,
Wishers were ever fools. O! come, come, come;
<STAGE DIR>
<They heave Antony aloft to Cleopatra.>
</STAGE DIR>
And welcome, welcome! die where thou hastliv'd;
Quicken with kissing; had my lips that power,
Thus would I wear them out.
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALL>	<84%>
A heavy sight!
</ALL>
<MARK ANTONY>	<84%>
I am dying, Egypt, dying:
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<84%>
No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
Provok'd by my offence.

<MARK ANTONY>	<84%>
One word, sweet queen.
Of Cæsar seek your honour with your safety. O!

<MARK ANTONY>	<84%>
Gentle, hear me:
None about Cæsar trust, but Proculeius.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<84%>
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Cæsar.
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK ANTONY>	<84%>
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I liv'd, the greatest prince o' the world,
The noblest; and do now not basely die,
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman; a Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
I can no more.
</MARK ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>	<84%>
Noblest of men, woo 't die?
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? O! see my women,
<STAGE DIR>
<Antony dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
O! wither'd is the garland of the war,
The soldier's pole is fall'n; young boys and girls
Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.

No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
Patience is sottish, and impatience does
Become a dog that's mad; then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death,
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look!
Our lamp is spent, it's out. Good sirs, take heart;—
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
This case of that huge spirit now is cold;
Ah! women, women. Come; we have no friend
But resolution, and the briefest end.

<CÆSAR>	<86%>
Wherefore is that? and what art thou that dar'st
Appear thus to us?
</CÆSAR>
<DERCETAS>	<86%>
I am call'd Dercetas;
Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
Best to be serv'd; whilst he stood up and spoke
He was my master, and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee, as I was to him
I'll be to Cæsar; if thou pleasest not,
I yield thee up my life.
</DERCETAS>
<CÆSAR>	<86%>
What is 't thou sayst?
</CÆSAR>
<DERCETAS>	<86%>
I say, O Cæsar, Antony is dead.
</DERCETAS>
<CÆSAR>	<86%>
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack; the round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets,
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
Is not a single doom; in the name lay
A moiety of the world.
</CÆSAR>
<DERCETAS>	<86%>
He is dead, Cæsar;
Not by a public minister of justice,
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
With his most noble blood.
</DERCETAS>
<CÆSAR>	<86%>
Look you sad, friends?
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
To wash the eyes of kings.

That nature must compel us to lament
Our most persisted deeds.

Wag'd equal with him.
</MECÆNAS>
<AGRIPPA>	<86%>
A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity; but you, gods, will give us
Some faults to make us men. Cæsar is touch'd.
</AGRIPPA>
<MECÆNAS>	<86%>
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
He needs must see himself.
</MECÆNAS>
<CÆSAR>	<86%>
O Antony!
I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day,
Or look on thine; we could not stall together
In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
That thou, my brother, my competitor
In top of all design, my mate in empire,
Friend and companion in the front of war,
The arm of mine own body, and the heart
Where mine his thoughts did kindle, that our stars,
Unreconciliable, should divide
Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends,—
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an Egyptian.>
</STAGE DIR>
But I will tell you at some meeter season:
The business of this man looks out of him;
</CÆSAR>
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
<EGYPTIAN>	<87%>
A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
Of thy intents desires instruction,
That she preparedly may frame herself
To the way she's forc'd to.
</EGYPTIAN>
<CÆSAR>	<87%>
Bid her have good heart;
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
How honourable and how kindly we
Determine for her; for Cæsar cannot live
To be ungentle.
</CÆSAR>
<EGYPTIAN>	<87%>
So the gods preserve thee!
</EGYPTIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CÆSAR>	<87%>
Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
We purpose her no shame; give her what comforts
The quality of her passion shall require,
Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
And how you find of her.

How he's employ'd, he shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war;
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings. Go with me, and see
What I can show in this.

<CLEOPATRA>	<88%>
My desolation does begin to make
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Cæsar;
Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
A minister of her will; and it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
Which shackles accidents, and bolts up change,
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
The beggar's nurse and Cæsar's.

<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
My name is Proculeius.

<CLEOPATRA>	<88%>
Antony
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
That have no use for trusting. If your master
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
That majesty, to keep decorum, must
No less beg than a kingdom; if he please
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
He gives me so much of mine own as I
Will kneel to him with thanks.
</CLEOPATRA>
<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
Be of good cheer;
You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing.
Make your full reference freely to my lord,
Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
On all that need; let me report to him
Your sweet dependancy, and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
</PROCULAEIUS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<89%>
Pray you, tell him
I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
Look him i' the face.

This I'll report, dear lady:

Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
If idle talk will once be necessary,
I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
Do Cæsar what he can. Know, sir, that I
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
Lay me stark nak'd, and let the water-flies
Blow me into abhorring! rather make
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
And hang me up in chains!

Assuredly you know me.

No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
Is 't not your trick?
</CLEOPATRA>
<DOLABELLA>	<90%>
I understand not, madam.
</DOLABELLA>
<CLEOPATRA>	<90%>
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
O! such another sleep, that I might see
But such another man.
</CLEOPATRA>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
If it might please ye,—
</DOLABELLA>
<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck
A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted
The little O, the earth.
</CLEOPATRA>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
Most sovereign creature,—
</DOLABELLA>
<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
His legs besfrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
Crested the world; his voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in 't, an autumn 'twas
That grew the more by reaping; his delights
Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above
The element they liv'd in; in his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
</CLEOPATRA>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
Cleopatra,—
</DOLABELLA>
<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
Think you there was, or might be, such a man
As this I dream'd of?
</CLEOPATRA>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
Gentle madam, no.
</DOLABELLA>
<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
It's past the size of dreaming; nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet to imagine
An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.
</CLEOPATRA>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
As answering to the weight: would I might never
O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root.
</DOLABELLA>
<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
I thank you, sir.

Cleopatra, know,
We will extenuate rather than enforce:
If you apply yourself to our intents,—
Which towards you are most gentle,—you shall find
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
Of my good purposes, and put your children
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

See! Cæsar! O, behold,

Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,

O Cæsar! what a wounding shame is this,
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy. Say, good Cæsar,
That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
Their mediation; must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
Beneath the fall I have. <STAGE DIR>

Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;

Will catch at us, like strumpets, and scald rimers
Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us, and present
Our Alexandrian revels. Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I' the posture of a whore.
</CLEOPATRA>
<IRAS>	<95%>
O, the good gods!
</IRAS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<95%>
Nay, that's certain.
</CLEOPATRA>
<IRAS>	<95%>
I'll never see it; for, I am sure my nails
Are stronger than mine eyes.
</IRAS>
<CLEOPATRA>	<95%>
Why, that's the way
To fool their preparation, and to conquer
Their most absurd intents.
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Charmian.>
</STAGE DIR>
Now, Charmian,
Show me, my women, like a queen; go fetch
My best attires; I am again for Cydnus,
To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Iras. A noise heard.>
</STAGE DIR>
Wherefore's this noise?
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter one of the Guard.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GUARD>	<96%>
Here is a rural fellow
That will not be denied your highness' presence:
He brings you figs.
</GUARD>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
Let him come in. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Guard.>
</STAGE DIR> What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing
Of woman in me; now from head to foot
I am marble-constant, now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Guard, with a Clown bringing in a basket.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GUARD>	<96%>
This is the man.
</GUARD>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
Avoid, and leave him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Guard.>
</STAGE DIR>
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
That kills and pains not?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<96%>
Truly, I have him; but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.
</CLOWN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
Remember'st thou any that have died on 't?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<96%>
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday; a very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty, how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report o' the worm; but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is most fallible, the worm's an odd worm.
</CLOWN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
Get thee hence; farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<96%>
I wish you all joy of the worm.
</CLOWN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Sets down the basket.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
Farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<97%>
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.
</CLOWN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
Ay, ay; farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<97%>
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
</CLOWN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<97%>
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.
</CLOWN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
Will it eat me?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<97%>
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman; I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.
</CLOWN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
Well, get thee gone; farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CLOWN>	<97%>
Yes, forsooth; I wish you joy of the worm.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
</CLOWN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Iras, with a robe, crown, &c.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me; now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call; I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
The luck of Cæsar, which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire, and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So; have you done?
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses them. Iras falls and dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts, and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
The gods themselves do weep.
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
This proves me base:
If she first meet the curled Antony,
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
<STAGE DIR>
<To the asp, which she applies to her breast.>
</STAGE DIR>
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie; poor venomous fool,
Be angry, and dispatch. O! couldst thou speak,
That I might hear thee call great Cæsar ass
Unpolicied.
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
O eastern star!
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
That sucks the nurse asleep?
</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
O, break! O, break!
</CHARMIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,—
O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.
<STAGE DIR>
<Applying another asp to her arm.>
</STAGE DIR>
What should I stay—
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
And golden Phœbus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it, and then play.
</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Guard, rushing in.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GUARD 1>	<98%>
Where is the queen?
</GUARD 1>
<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
Speak softly, wake her not.
</CHARMIAN>
<GUARD 1>	<98%>
Cæsar hath sent—
</GUARD 1>
<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
Too slow a messenger.
<STAGE DIR>
<Applies an asp.>
</STAGE DIR>
O! come apace, dispatch; I partly feel thee.
</CHARMIAN>
<GUARD 1>	<99%>
Approach, ho! All's not well; Cæsar's beguil'd.
</GUARD 1>
<GUARD 2>	<99%>
There's Dolabella sent from Cæsar; call him.
</GUARD 2>
<GUARD 1>	<99%>
What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
</GUARD 1>
<CHARMIAN>	<99%>
It is well done, and fitting for a princess
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah! soldier.
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Dolabella.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
How goes it here?
</DOLABELLA>
<GUARD 2>	<99%>
All dead.
</GUARD 2>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
Cæsar, thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this; thyself art coming
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
So sought'st to hinder.
<STAGE DIR>
<Within, 'A way there!—a way for Cæsar!'>
</STAGE DIR>
</DOLABELLA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Cæsar and all his Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
O! sir, you are too sure an augurer;
That you did fear is done.
</DOLABELLA>
<CÆSAR>	<99%>
Bravest at the last,
She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
I do not see them bleed.
</CÆSAR>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
Who was last with them?
</DOLABELLA>
<GUARD 1>	<99%>
A simple countryman that brought her figs:
This was his basket.
</GUARD 1>
<CÆSAR>	<99%>
Poison'd then.
</CÆSAR>
<GUARD 1>	<99%>
O Cæsar!
This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood, and spake:
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
And on the sudden dropp'd.
</GUARD 1>
<CÆSAR>	<99%>
O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.
</CÆSAR>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
Here, on her breast,
There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
The like is on her arm.
</DOLABELLA>
<GUARD 1>	<100%>
This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
Upon the caves of Nile.
</GUARD 1>
<CÆSAR>	<100%>
Most probable
That so she died; for her physician tells me
She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
And bear her women from the monument.
She shall be buried by her Antony:
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous. High events as these
Strike those that make them; and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall,
In solemn show, attend this funeral,
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
High order in this great solemnity.
</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
