The Sunrise runs for Both --
The East -- Her Purple Troth
Keeps with the Hill --
The Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover Two --
Remotest -- still --
Nor does the Night forget
A Lamp for Each -- to set --
Wicks wide away -- The North --
Her blazing Sign Erects in Iodine --
Till Both -- can see --
The Midnight's Dusky Arms
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes
And so
Upon Her Bosom -- One --
And One upon Her Hem
Both lie --
