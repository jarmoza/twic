The Sun and Moon must make their haste -
The Stars express around
For in the Zones of Paradise
The Lord alone is burned -
His Eye, it is the East and West -
The North and South when He
Do concentrate His Countenance
Like Glow Worms, flee away -
Oh Poor and Far -
Oh Hindered Eye
That hunted for the Day -
The Lord a Candle entertains
Entirely for Thee -
