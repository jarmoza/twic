Summer begins to have the look
Peruser of enchanting Book
Reluctantly but sure perceives
A gain upon the backward leaves
Autumn begins to be inferred
By millinery of the cloud
Or deeper color in the shawl
That wraps the everlasting hill
The eye begins it's avarice
A meditation chastens speech
Some Dyer of a distant tree
Resumes his gaudy industry
Conclusion is the course of all
Almost to be perennial
And then elude stability
Recalls to immortality -
