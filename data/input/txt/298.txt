The Rose did caper on her cheek -
Her Boddice rose and fell -
Her pretty speech - like drunken men -
Did stagger pitiful -
Her fingers fumbled at her work -
Her needle would not go -
What ailed so smart a little maid -
It puzzled me to know -
Till opposite - I spied a cheek
That bore Rose -
opposite - another speech
That like the Drunkard goes -
A Vest that like her Boddice, danced -
To the immortal tune -
Till those two troubled - little Clocks
Ticked softly into one.
