Fitter to see Him, I may be
For the long Hindrance - Grace - to Me -
With Summers, and with Winters, grow,
Some passing Year - a trait bestow
To make Me fairest of the Earth -
The Waiting - then - will seem so worth
I shall impute with half a pain
The blame that I was  chosen - then -
Time to anticipate His Gaze -
It's first - Delight - and then - Surprise -
The turning o'er and o'er my face
For Evidence it be the Grace -
He left behind One Day - So less
He seek conviction, That - be This -
I only must not grow so new
That He'll mistake - and ask for me
Of me - when first unto the Door
I go - to Elsewhere go no more
I only must not change so fair
He'll sigh - "The Other - She - is Where"?
The Love, tho', will array me right
I shall be perfect - in His sight -
If He perceive the other Truth -
Opon an Excellenter Youth -
How sweet I shall not lack in Vain -
But gain - thro' loss - Through Grief - obtain -
The Beauty that reward Him most -
The Beauty of Demand - at Rest -
