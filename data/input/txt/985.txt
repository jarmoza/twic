Nature - the Gentlest Mother is,
Impatient of no Child -
The feeblest - or the -
Her Admonition mild -
In Forest - and the Hill -
By Traveller - be heard -
Restraining Rampant Squirrel -
Or too impetuous Bird -
How fair Her Conversation -
A Summer Afternoon -
Her Household - Her Assembly -
And when the Sun go down -
Her Voice among the Aisles
Incite the timid prayer
Of the minutest Cricket -
The most unworthy Flower -
When all the Children sleep -
She turns as long away
As will suffice to light Her lamps -
Then bending from the Sky -
With infinite Affection -
And infiniter Care -
Her Golden finger on Her lip -
Wills Silence - Everywhere -
