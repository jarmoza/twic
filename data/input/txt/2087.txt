The Robin is a Gabriel
In humble circumstances -
His Dress denotes him socially,
Of Transport's Working Classes -
He has the punctuality
Of the New England Farmer -
The same oblique integrity,
A Vista vastly warmer -
A small but sturdy Residence,
A Self denying Household,
The Guests of Perspicacity
Are all that cross his Threshold -
As covert as a Fugitive,
Cajoling Consternation
By Ditties to the Enemy
And Silvan Punctuation -
