A Lady red - amid the Hill
Her annual secret keeps!
A Lady white, within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps!
The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms -
Sweep vale - and hill - and tree!
Prithee, my pretty Housewives!
Who may expected be?
The neighbors do not yet suspect!
The woods exchange a smile!
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird -
In such a little while!
And yet, how still the Landscape stands!
How nonchalant the Hedge!
As if the "Resurrection"
Were nothing very strange!
