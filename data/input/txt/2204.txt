No Brigadier throughout the Year
So civic as the Jay -
A Neighbor and a Warrior too
With shrill felicity
Pursuing Winds that censure us
A Febuary Day,
The Brother of the Universe
Was never blown away -
The Snow and he are intimate -
I've often seen them play
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment
To their temerity -
The Pillow of this daring Head
Is pungent Evergreens -
His Larder - terse and Militant -
Unknown - refreshing things -
His Character - a Tonic -
His Future - a Dispute -
Unfair an Immortality
That leaves this Neighbor out -
