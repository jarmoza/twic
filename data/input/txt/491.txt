Before I got my eye put out -
I liked as well to see
As other creatures, that have eyes -
And know no other way -
But were it told to me, Today,
That I might have the Sky
For mine, I tell you that my Heart
Would split, for size of me -
The Meadows - mine -
The Mountains - mine -
All Forests - Stintless stars -
As much of noon, as I could take -
Between my finite eyes -
The Motions of the Dipping Birds -
The Lightning's jointed Road -
For mine - to look at when I liked,
The news would strike me dead -
So safer - guess - with just my soul
Opon the window pane
Where other creatures put their eyes -
Incautious - of the Sun -
