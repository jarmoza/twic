The Whole of it came not at once -
'Twas Murder by degrees -
A Thrust - and then for Life a chance -
The Bliss to cauterize -
The Cat reprieves the mouse
She eases from her teeth
Just long enough for Hope to teaze -
Then mashes it to death -
'Tis Life's award - to die -
Contenteder if once -
Than dying half - then rallying
For consciouser Eclipse -
