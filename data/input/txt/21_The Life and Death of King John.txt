<Scene.—Sometimes in England, and sometimes in France.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ACT 1>
<SCENE 1>
<A Room of State in the Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter King John, Queen Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, Salisbury, and Others, with Chatillon.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<0%>
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
</K. JOHN>
<CHATILLON>	<1%>
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France,
In my behaviour, to the majesty,
The borrow'd majesty of England here.
</CHATILLON>
<ELINOR>	<1%>
A strange beginning; 'borrow'd majesty!'
</ELINOR>
<K. JOHN>	<1%>
Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
</K. JOHN>
<CHATILLON>	<1%>
Philip of France, in right and true behalf
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
To this fair island and the territories,
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine;
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
</CHATILLON>
<K. JOHN>	<1%>
What follows if we disallow of this?
</K. JOHN>
<CHATILLON>	<1%>
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
</CHATILLON>
<K. JOHN>	<1%>
Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
</K. JOHN>
<CHATILLON>	<1%>
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
The furthest limit of my embassy.
</CHATILLON>
<K. JOHN>	<1%>
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
For ere thou canst report I will be there,
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
So, hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honourable conduct let him have:
Pembroke, look to't. Farewell, Chatillon.
</K. JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Chatillon and Pembroke.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ELINOR>	<2%>
What now, my son! have I not ever said
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world
Upon the right and party of her son?
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love,
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
</ELINOR>
<K. JOHN>	<2%>
Our strong possession and our right for us.
</K. JOHN>
<ELINOR>	<2%>
Your strong possession much more than your right,
Or else it must go wrong, with you and me:
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
</ELINOR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Sheriff, who whispers Essex.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ESSEX>	<2%>
My liege, here is the strangest controversy,
Come from the country to be judg'd by you,
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?
</ESSEX>
<K. JOHN>	<2%>
Let them approach.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Sheriff.>
</STAGE DIR>
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
This expedition's charge.
</K. JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Sheriff, with Robert Faulconbridge and Philip, his Bastard Brother.>
</STAGE DIR>
What men are you?
<BASTARD>	<3%>
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
Of Cœur-de-Lion knighted in the field.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<3%>
What art thou?
</K. JOHN>
<ROBERT>	<3%>
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
</ROBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<3%>
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
You came not of one mother then, it seems.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<3%>
Most certain of one mother, mighty king,
That is well known: and, as I think, one father:
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
</BASTARD>
<ELINOR>	<3%>
Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
And wound her honour with this diffidence.
</ELINOR>
<BASTARD>	<3%>
I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<3%>
A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<3%>
I know not why, except to get the land.
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
But whe'r I be as true-begot or no,
That still I lay upon my mother's head;
But that I am as well-begot, my liege,—
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!—
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
If old Sir Robert did beget us both,
And were our father, and this son like him;
O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<4%>
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
</K. JOHN>
<ELINOR>	<4%>
He hath a trick of Cœur-de-Lion's face;
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man?
</ELINOR>
<K. JOHN>	<4%>
Mine eye hath well examined his parts,
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak:
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<4%>
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
With half that face would he have all my land;
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
</BASTARD>
<ROBERT>	<4%>
My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
Your brother did employ my father much,—
</ROBERT>
<BASTARD>	<4%>
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
</BASTARD>
<ROBERT>	<4%>
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
To Germany, there with the emperor
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
The advantage of his absence took the king,
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay,—
As I have heard my father speak himself,—
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
His lands to me, and took it on his death
That this my mother's son was none of his;
An if he were, he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
My father's land, as was my father's will.
</ROBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<5%>
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
In sooth he might: then, if he were my brother's,
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
My mother's son did get your father's heir;
Your father's heir must have your father's land.
</K. JOHN>
<ROBERT>	<5%>
Shall then my father's will be of no force
To dispossess that child which is not his?
</ROBERT>
<BASTARD>	<6%>
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
Than was his will to get me, as I think.
</BASTARD>
<ELINOR>	<6%>
Whe'r hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
Or the reputed son of Cœur-de-Lion,
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
</ELINOR>
<BASTARD>	<6%>
Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
And I had his, Sir Robert his, like him;
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say, 'Look, where three-far-things goes!'
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
Would I might never stir from off this place,
I'd give it every foot to have this face:
I would not be Sir Nob in any case.
</BASTARD>
<ELINOR>	<6%>
I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?
I am a soldier and now bound to France.
</ELINOR>
<BASTARD>	<6%>
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
Your face hath got five hundred pounds a year,
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
</BASTARD>
<ELINOR>	<6%>
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
</ELINOR>
<BASTARD>	<6%>
Our country manners give our betters way.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<6%>
What is thy name?
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<6%>
Philip, my liege, so is my name begun;
Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<7%>
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
Kneel thou down Philip, but arise more great;
Arise Sir Richard, and Plantagenet.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<7%>
Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,
When I was got, Sir Robert was away!
</BASTARD>
<ELINOR>	<7%>
The very spirit of Plantagenet!
I am thy grandam, Richard: call me so.
</ELINOR>
<BASTARD>	<7%>
Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
Something about, a little from the right,
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
And have is have, however men do catch.
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<7%>
Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
Come, madam, and come, Richard: we must speed
For France, for France, for it is more than need.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<7%>
Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all but the Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR>
A foot of honour better than I was,
But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
'Good den, Sir Richard!' 'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
'Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion. Now your traveller,
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
Why then I suck my teeth, and catechize
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'—
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,—
'I shall beseech you,'—that is question now;
And then comes answer like an absey-book:
'O, sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
At your employment; at your service, sir:'
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
Saving in dialogue of compliment,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
The Pyrenean and the river Po,
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
But this is worshipful society
And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
For he is but a bastard to the time,
That doth not smack of observation;
And so am I, whether I smack or no;
And not alone in habit and device,
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
But from the inward motion to deliver
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.>
</STAGE DIR>
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
</BASTARD>
What brings you here to court so hastily?
<LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>	<9%>
Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
</LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>
<BASTARD>	<9%>
My brother Robert? old Sir Robert's son?
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
Is it Sir Robert's son that you seek so?
</BASTARD>
<LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>	<9%>
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at Sir Robert?
He is Sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
</LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>
<BASTARD>	<9%>
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
</BASTARD>
<GURNEY>	<9%>
Good leave, good Philip.
</GURNEY>
<BASTARD>	<9%>
Philip! sparrow! James,
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Gurney.>
</STAGE DIR>
Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son:
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast.
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
</BASTARD>
<LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>	<10%>
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
</LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>
<BASTARD>	<10%>
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
What! I am dubb'd; I have it on my shoulder.
But, mother, I am not Sir Robert's son;
I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land;
Legitimation, name, and all is gone.
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
Some proper man, I hope; who was it, mother?
</BASTARD>
<LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>	<10%>
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
</LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>
<BASTARD>	<10%>
As faithfully as I deny the devil.
</BASTARD>
<LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>	<10%>
King Richard Cœur-de-Lion was thy father:
By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd
To make room for him in my husband's bed.
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence.
</LADY FAULCONBRIDGE>
<BASTARD>	<10%>
Now, by this light, were I to get again,
Madam, I would not wish a better father.
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
Subjected tribute to commanding love,
Against whose fury and unmatched force
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
Who says it was, he lies: I say, 'twas not.

<ACT 2>
<SCENE 1>
<France. Before the Walls of Angiers.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter, on one side, the Duke of Austria, and Forces;...>
<... on the other, Philip, King of France, and Forces, Lewis, Constance, Arthur, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. PHILIP>	<11%>
Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
By this brave duke came early to his grave:
And, for amends to his posterity,
At our importance hither is he come,
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
And to rebuke the usurpation
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
</K. PHILIP>
<ARTHUR>	<12%>
God shall forgive you Cœur-de-Lion's death
The rather that you give his offspring life,
Shadowing their right under your wings of war.
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
But with a heart full of unstained love:
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.
</ARTHUR>
<K. PHILIP>	<12%>
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
</K. PHILIP>
<AUSTRIA>	<12%>
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
As seal to this indenture of my love,
That to my home I will no more return
Till Angiers, and the right thou hast in France,
Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore,
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
And coops from other lands her islanders,
Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main,
That water-walled bulwark, still secure
And confident from foreign purposes,
Even till that utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
</AUSTRIA>
<CONSTANCE>	<12%>
O! take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
To make a more requital to your love.
</CONSTANCE>
<AUSTRIA>	<12%>
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war.
</AUSTRIA>
<K. PHILIP>	<12%>
Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent
Against the brows of this resisting town.
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
To cull the plots of best advantages:
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
But we will make it subject to this boy.
</K. PHILIP>
<CONSTANCE>	<13%>
Stay for an answer to your embassy,
Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood.
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That right in peace which here we urge in war;
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
</CONSTANCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Chatillon.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. PHILIP>	<13%>
A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
Our messenger, Chatillon, is arriv'd!
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.
</K. PHILIP>
<CHATILLON>	<13%>
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
And stir them up against a mightier task.
England, impatient of your just demands,
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
To land his legions all as soon as I;
His marches are expedient to this town,
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
With him along is come the mother-queen,
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd;
And all the unsettled humours of the land,
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
To make a hazard of new fortunes here.
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
Did never float upon the swelling tide,
To do offence and scathe in Christendom.
<STAGE DIR>
<Drums heard within.>
</STAGE DIR>
The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,
To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.
</CHATILLON>
<K. PHILIP>	<14%>
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
</K. PHILIP>
<AUSTRIA>	<14%>
By how much unexpected, by so much
We must awake endeavour for defence,
For courage mounteth with occasion:
Let them be welcome then, we are prepar'd.
</AUSTRIA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter King John, Elinor, Blanch, the Bastard, Lords, and Forces.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<14%>
Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven.
</K. JOHN>
<K. PHILIP>	<15%>
Peace be to England, if that war return
From France to England, there to live in peace.
England we love; and, for that England's sake
With burden of our armour here we sweat:
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
But thou from loving England art so far
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,
Cut off the sequence of posterity,
Out-faced infant state, and done a rape
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face:
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his;
This little abstract doth contain that large
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right
And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
When living blood doth in these temples beat,
Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?
</K. PHILIP>
<K. JOHN>	<15%>
From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
To draw my answer from thy articles?
</K. JOHN>
<K. PHILIP>	<15%>
From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts
In any breast of strong authority,
To look into the blots and stains of right:
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
</K. PHILIP>
<K. JOHN>	<16%>
Alack! thou dost usurp authority.
</K. JOHN>
<K. PHILIP>	<16%>
Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.

<CONSTANCE>	<16%>
My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband, and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
Than thou and John in manners; being as like
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
My boy a bastard! By my soul I think
His father never was so true begot:
It cannot be an if thou wert his mother.

<AUSTRIA>	<16%>
What the devil art thou?
</AUSTRIA>
<BASTARD>	<16%>
One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
An a' may catch your hide and you alone.
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard.
I'll smoke your skin coat, an I catch you right.
Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.

<BLANCH>	<16%>
O! well did he become that lion's robe,
That did disrobe the lion of that robe.
</BLANCH>

It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:
But, ass, I'll take that burden from your back,
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.

<AUSTRIA>	<17%>
What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath?
King,—Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
</AUSTRIA>
<K. PHILIP>	<17%>
Women and fools, break off your conference.
King John, this is the very sum of all:
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee.
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
</K. PHILIP>
<K. JOHN>	<17%>
My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.
Arthur of Britaine, yield thee to my hand;
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win.
Submit thee, boy.

Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib'd
To do him justice and revenge on you.

Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp
The dominations, royalties, and rights
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
The canon of the law is laid on him,
Being but the second generation
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.

Bedlam, have done.

But God hath made her sin and her the plague
On this removed issue, plagu'd for her,
And with her plague, her sin; his injury
Her injury, the beadle to her sin,
All punish'd in the person of this child,
And all for her. A plague upon her!

You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle,—
</K. PHILIP>
<K. JOHN>	<19%>
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
These flags of France, that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town,
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
All preparation for a bloody siege
And merciless proceeding by these French
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
That as a waist do girdle you about,
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
But on the sight of us your lawful king,—
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
To save unscratch'd your city's threaten'd cheeks,—
Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle;
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
To make a shaking fever in your walls,
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
To make a faithless error in your ears:
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
Crave harbourage within your city walls.
</K. JOHN>
<K. PHILIP>	<20%>
When I have said, make answer to us both.
Lo! in this right hand, whose protection
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
Son to the elder brother of this man,
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:
For this down-trodden equity, we tread
In war-like march these greens before your town,
Being no further enemy to you
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal,
In the relief of this oppressed child,
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
To pay that duty which you truly owe
To him that owes it, namely, this young prince;
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
Save in aspect, have all offence seal'd up;
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd,
We will bear home that lusty blood again
Which here we came to spout against your town,
And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls
Can hide you from our messengers of war,
Though all these English and their discipline
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
In that behalf which we have challeng'd it?
Or shall we give the signal to our rage
And stalk in blood to our possession?

There stuck no plume in any English crest

By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,

That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
Is near to England: look upon the years
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
If not complete of, say he is not she;
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
If want it be not that she is not he:
He is the half part of a blessed man,
Left to be finished by such a she;
And she a fair divided excellence,
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
O! two such silver currents, when they join,
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
To these two princes, if you marry them.
This union shall do more than battery can
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
And give you entrance; but without this match,
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
More free from motion, no, not death himself
In mortal fury half so peremptory,
As we to keep this city.

Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,

As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs.
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
He gives the bastinado with his tongue;
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
But buffets better than a fist of France.

With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
Who having no external thing to lose
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,

Made to run even upon even ground,
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
This sway of motion, this Commodity,
Makes it take head from all indifferency,
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
And this same bias, this Commodity,
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
From a resolv'd and honourable war,
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
And why rail I on this Commodity?
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet.
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
When his fair angels would salute my palm;
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail,
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary.

Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjur'd kings!
A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjur'd kings!
Hear me! O, hear me!

Thou Fortune's champion, that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! thou art perjur'd too,
And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag, and stamp and swear
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?
Been sworn my soldier? bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?

<PANDULPH>	<39%>
Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
So wilfully dost spurn; and, force perforce,
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
</PANDULPH>
<K. JOHN>	<39%>
What earthly name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more: that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we under heaven are supreme head,
So under him that great supremacy,
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
So tell the pope; all reverence set apart
To him, and his usurp'd authority.
</K. JOHN>
<K. PHILIP>	<40%>
Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
</K. PHILIP>
<K. JOHN>	<40%>
Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
And, by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself;
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish;
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the pope, and count his friends my foes.
</K. JOHN>
<PANDULPH>	<40%>
Then, by the lawful power that I have,
Thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate:
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to a heretic;
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint,
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life.

Good father cardinal, cry thou amen

There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?

Good reverend father, make my person yours,
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
And the conjunction of our inward souls
Married in league, coupled and link'd together
With all religious strength of sacred vows;
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love,
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;
And even before this truce, but new before,
No longer than we well could wash our hands
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and overstain'd
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
The fearful difference of incensed kings:
And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,
So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity? O! holy sir,
My reverend father, let it not be so!
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
Some gentle order, and then we shall be bless'd
To do your pleasure and continue friends.
</K. PHILIP>
<PANDULPH>	<43%>
All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England's love.
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
</PANDULPH>
<K. PHILIP>	<44%>
I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
</K. PHILIP>
<PANDULPH>	<44%>
So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith:
And like a civil war sett'st oath to oath,
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O! let thy vow
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd;
That is, to be the champion of our church.
What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself;
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done;
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it.
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
It is religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion
By what thou swear'st, against the thing thou swear'st,
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions:
Upon which better part our prayers come in,
If thou vouchsafe them; but, if not, then know
The peril of our curses light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under their black weight.

Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet;
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say, but let it go:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience: if the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound one into the drowsy race of night;
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
A passion hateful to my purposes;
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
But ah! I will not: yet I love thee well;
And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.

On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,

And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.

And ring these fingers with thy household worms,

My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost!
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
For then 'tis like I should forget myself:
O! if I could, what grief should I forget.
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
And thou shalt be canoniz'd, cardinal;
For being not mad but sensible of grief,
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
If I were mad, I should forget my son,
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.
I am not mad: too well, too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity.
</CONSTANCE>
<K. PHILIP>	<53%>
Bind up those tresses. O! what love I note
In the fair multitude of those her hairs:
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Do glue themselves in sociable grief;
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
Sticking together in calamity.
</K. PHILIP>
<CONSTANCE>	<53%>

</CONSTANCE>
<K. PHILIP>	<53%>
Bind up your hairs.
</K. PHILIP>

Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
I tore them from their bonds, and cried aloud
'O! that these hands could so redeem my son,
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
But now I envy at their liberty,
And will again commit them to their bonds,
Because my poor child is a prisoner.
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.
If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
There was not such a gracious creature born.
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him: therefore never, never
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form:
Then have I reason to be fond of grief.
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
I could give better comfort than you do.
I will not keep this form upon my head
When there is such disorder in my wit.
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!

One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
And he that stands upon a slippery place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
So be it, for it cannot be but so.
</PANDULPH>
<LEWIS>	<56%>
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
</LEWIS>
<PANDULPH>	<56%>
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
</PANDULPH>
<LEWIS>	<56%>
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
</LEWIS>
<PANDULPH>	<56%>
How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To check his reign, but they will cherish it;
No natural exhalation in the sky,
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
No common wind, no customed event,
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
</PANDULPH>
<LEWIS>	<57%>
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
</LEWIS>
<PANDULPH>	<57%>
O! sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And, O! what better matter breeds for you
Than I have nam'd. The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England ransacking the church,
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their side;
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin!
Go with me to the king. 'Tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent
Now that their souls are topful of offence.
For England go; I will whet on the king.
</PANDULPH>
<LEWIS>	<57%>
Strong reasons make strong actions. Let us go:
If you say ay, the king will not say no.

<SCENE 1>
<Northampton. A Room in the Castle.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hubert and Two Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HUBERT>	<58%>
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
Within the arras: when I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair: be heedful. Hence, and watch.
</HUBERT>
<ATTENDANT 1>	<58%>
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
</ATTENDANT 1>
<HUBERT>	<58%>
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
</HUBERT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Arthur.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ARTHUR>	<58%>
Good morrow, Hubert.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<58%>
Good morrow, little prince.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<58%>
As little prince,—having so great a title
To be more prince,—as may be. You are sad.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<58%>
Indeed, I have been merrier.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<58%>
Mercy on me!
Methinks nobody should be sad but I:
Yet I remember, when I was in France,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
I should be as merry as the day is long;
And so I would be here, but that I doubt
My uncle practises more harm to me:
He is afraid of me, and I of him.
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<59%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> If I talk to him with his innocent prate
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<59%>
Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
That I might sit all night and watch with you:
I warrant I love you more than you do me.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<59%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> His words do take possession of my bosom.
Read here, young Arthur.
<STAGE DIR>
<Showing a paper.>
</STAGE DIR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> How now, foolish rheum!
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
I must be brief, lest resolution drop
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
Can you not read it? is it not fair writ?
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<59%>
Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<59%>
Young boy, I must.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<59%>
And will you?
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<59%>
And I will.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<59%>
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
I knit my handkercher about your brows,—
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,—
And I did never ask it you again;
And with my hand at midnight held your head,
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
Saying, 'What lack you?' and, 'Where lies your grief?'
Or, 'What good love may I perform for you?'
Many a poor man's son would have lain still,
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
But you at your sick-service had a prince.
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
And call it cunning: do an if you will.
If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill,
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you?
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<60%>
I have sworn to do it;
And with hot irons must I burn them out.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<60%>
Ah! none but in this iron age would do it!
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
And quench this fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence;
Nay, after that, consume away in rust,
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
I would not have believ'd him; no tongue but Hubert's.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<60%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Stamps.>
</STAGE DIR> Come forth.
</HUBERT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Attendants, with cord, irons, &c.>
</STAGE DIR>
Do as I bid you do.
<ARTHUR>	<60%>
O! save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<61%>
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<61%>
Alas! what need you be so boisterousrough?
I will not struggle; I will stand stone-still.
For heaven's sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
Nay, hear me, Hubert: drive these men away,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
Nor look upon the iron angerly.
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
Whatever torment you do put me to.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<61%>
Go, stand within: let me alone with him.
</HUBERT>
<ATTENDANT 1>	<61%>
I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.
</ATTENDANT 1>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ARTHUR>	<61%>
Alas! I then have chid away my friend:
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart.
Let him come back, that his compassion may
Give life to yours.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<61%>
Come, boy, prepare yourself.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<61%>
Is there no remedy?
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<61%>
None, but to lose your eyes.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<61%>
O heaven! that there were but a mote in yours,
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
Any annoyance in that precious sense;
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<61%>
Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<62%>
Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
Let me not hold my tongue; let me not, Hubert:
Or Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
So I may keep mine eyes: O! spare mine eyes,
Though to no use but still to look on you:
Lo! by my troth, the instrument is cold
And would not harm me.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<62%>
I can heat it, boy.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<62%>
No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
Being create for comfort, to be us'd
In undeserv'd extremes: see else yourself;
There is no malice in this burning coal;
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<62%>
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<62%>
An if you do you will but make it blush
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
All things that you should use to do me wrong
Deny their office: only you do lack
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<62%>
Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eyes
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
With this same very iron to burn them out.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<63%>
O! now you look like Hubert, all this while
You were disguised.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<63%>
Peace! no more. Adieu.
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
That Hubert for the wealth of all the world
Will not offend thee.
</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>	<63%>
O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>	<63%>
Silence! no more, go closely in with me:
Much danger do I undergo for thee.
</HUBERT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 1>
<SCENE 2>
<The Same. A Room of State in the Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter King John, crowned; Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lords. The King takes his state.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<63%>
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
And look'd upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
</K. JOHN>
<PEMBROKE>	<63%>
This 'once again,' but that your highness pleas'd,
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any long'd-for change or better state.
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>	<63%>
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
To guard a title that was rich before,
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<64%>
But that your royal pleasure must be done,
This act is as an ancient tale new told,
And in the last repeating troublesome,
Being urged at a time unseasonable.
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>	<64%>
In this the antique and well-noted face
Of plain old form is much disfigured;
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
Startles and frights consideration,
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<64%>
When workmen strive to do better than well
They do confound their skill in covetousness;
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse:
As patches set upon a little breach
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>	<64%>
To this effect, before you were newcrown'd,
We breath'd our counsel: but it pleas'd your highness
To overbear it, and we are all well pleas'd;
Since all and every part of what we would
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
</SALISBURY>
<K. JOHN>	<65%>
Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
And more, more strong,—when lesser is my fear,—
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
What you would have reform'd that is not well;
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your requests.
</K. JOHN>
<PEMBROKE>	<65%>
Then I,—as one that am the tongue of these
To sound the purposes of all their hearts,—
Both for myself and them,—but, chief of all,
Your safety, for the which myself and them
Bend their best studies,—heartily request
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument:
If what in rest you have in right you hold,
Why then your fears,—which, as they say, attend
The steps of wrong,—should move you to mew up
Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise?
That the time's enemies may not have this
To grace occasions, let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask, his liberty;
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
</PEMBROKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hubert.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<66%>
Let it be so: I do commit his youth
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?
</K. JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Taking him apart.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PEMBROKE>	<66%>
This is the man should do the bloody deed;
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
The image of a wicked hemous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>	<66%>
The colour of the king doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience,
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
His passion is so ripe it needs must break.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<66%>
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
</PEMBROKE>
<K. JOHN>	<66%>
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
Good lords, although my will to give is living,
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.
</K. JOHN>
<SALISBURY>	<66%>
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<66%>
Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick:
This must be answer'd, either here or hence.
</PEMBROKE>
<K. JOHN>	<66%>
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
</K. JOHN>
<SALISBURY>	<67%>
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it:
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<67%>
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
And find the inheritance of this poor child,
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle,
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
</PEMBROKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lords.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<67%>
They burn in indignation. I repent:
There is no sure foundation set on blood,
No certain life achiev'd by others' death.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
</K. JOHN>
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
<MESSENGER>	<67%>
From France to England. Never such a power
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land.
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
For when you should be told they do prepare,
The tidings come that they are all arriv'd.
</MESSENGER>
<K. JOHN>	<67%>
O! where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care
That such an army could be drawn in France,
And she not hear of it?
</K. JOHN>
<MESSENGER>	<68%>
My liege, her ear
Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died
Your noble mother; and, as I hear, my lord,
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.
</MESSENGER>
<K. JOHN>	<68%>
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
O! make a league with me, till I have pleas'd
My discontented peers. What! mother dead!
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here?
</K. JOHN>
<MESSENGER>	<68%>
Under the Dauphin.
</MESSENGER>
<K. JOHN>	<68%>
Thou hast made me giddy
With these ill tidings.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Bastard, and Peter of Pomfret.>
</STAGE DIR>
Now, what says the world
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
</K. JOHN>
My head with more ill news, for it is full.
<BASTARD>	<68%>
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<68%>
Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
Under the tide; but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood, and can give audience
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<68%>
How I have sped among the clergymen,
The sums I have collected shall express.
But as I travell'd hither through the land,
I find the people strangely fantasied,
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear.
And here's a prophet that I brought with me
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rimes,
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
Your highness should deliver up your crown.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<69%>
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
</K. JOHN>
<PETER>	<69%>
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
</PETER>
<K. JOHN>	<69%>
Hubert, away with him; imprison him:
And on that day at noon, whereon, he says,
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
Deliver him to safety, and return,
For I must use thee.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Hubert, with Peter.>
</STAGE DIR>
O my gentle cousin,
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd?
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<69%>
The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
And others more, going to seek the grave
Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
On your suggestion.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<69%>
Gentle kinsman, go,
And thrust thyself into their companies.
I have a way to win their loves again;
Bring them before me.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<70%>
I will seek them out.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<70%>
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
O! let me have no subject enemies
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion.
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
And fly like thought from them to me again.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<70%>
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<70%>
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR>
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
And be thou he.
</K. JOHN>
<MESSENGER>	<70%>
With all my heart, my liege.
</MESSENGER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<70%>
My mother dead!
</K. JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Hubert.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HUBERT>	<70%>
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night:
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion.
</HUBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<70%>
Five moons!
</K. JOHN>
<HUBERT>	<70%>
Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks, doth gripe the hearer's wrist
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Standing on slippers,—which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,—
Told of a many thousand warlike French,
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.
Another lean unwash'd artificer
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
</HUBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<71%>
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
</K. JOHN>
<HUBERT>	<71%>
No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
</HUBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<71%>
It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life,
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law, to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when, perchance, it frowns
More upon humour than advis'd respect.
</K. JOHN>
<HUBERT>	<71%>
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
</HUBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<71%>
O! when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation.
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Makes ill deeds done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into my mind;
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
</K. JOHN>
<HUBERT>	<72%>
My lord,—
</HUBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<72%>
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is brav'd,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
</K. JOHN>
<HUBERT>	<72%>
Arm you against your other enemies,
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
Within this bosom never enter'd yet
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
</HUBERT>
<K. JOHN>	<73%>
Doth Arthur live? O! haste thee to the peers,
Throw this report on their incensed rage,
And make them tame to their obedience.
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
O! answer not; but to my closet bring
The angry lords, with all expedient haste.
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.

The wall is high; and yet will I leap down
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
There's few or none do know me; if they did,
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite.
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,

As good to die and go, as die and stay.

<SALISBURY>	<74%>
Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury.
It is our safety, and we must embrace
This gentle offer of the perilous time.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<74%>
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>	<74%>
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France;
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love,
Is much more general than these lines import.
</SALISBURY>
<BIGOT>	<74%>
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
</BIGOT>
<SALISBURY>	<74%>
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
Two long days' journey, lords, or e'er we meet.
</SALISBURY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BASTARD>	<74%>
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
The king by me requests your presence straight.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<74%>
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
</SALISBURY>
<BASTARD>	<74%>
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<75%>
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
</SALISBURY>
<BASTARD>	<75%>
But there is little reason in your grief;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
</BASTARD>
<PEMBROKE>	<75%>
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
</PEMBROKE>
<BASTARD>	<75%>
'Tis true; to hurt his master, no man else.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<75%>
This is the prison.
<STAGE DIR>
<Seeing Arthur.>
</STAGE DIR>
What is he lies here?
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<75%>
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>	<75%>
Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
</SALISBURY>
<BIGOT>	<75%>
Or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
</BIGOT>
<SALISBURY>	<75%>
Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
Or have you read, or heard? or could you think?
Or do you almost think, although you see,
That you do see? could thought, without this object,
Form such another? This is the very top,
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<75%>
All murders past do stand excus'd in this:
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
</PEMBROKE>
<BASTARD>	<76%>
It is a damned and a bloody work;
The graceless action of a heavy hand,
If that it be the work of any hand.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<76%>
If that it be the work of any hand!
We had a kind of light what would ensue:
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
The practice and the purpose of the king:
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
Never to be infected with delight,
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
Till I have set a glory to this hand,
By giving it the worship of revenge.
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>	<76%>
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
</PEMBROKE>
<BIGOT>	<76%>
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
</BIGOT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hubert.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HUBERT>	<76%>
Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
Arthur doth live: the king hath sent for you.
</HUBERT>
<SALISBURY>	<76%>
O! he is bold and blushes not at death.
Avaunt, thou hateful villain! get thee gone.
</SALISBURY>
<HUBERT>	<76%>
I am no villain.
</HUBERT>
<SALISBURY>	<76%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Drawing his sword.>
</STAGE DIR> Must I rob the law?
</SALISBURY>
<BASTARD>	<77%>
Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<77%>
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
</SALISBURY>
<HUBERT>	<77%>
Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say:
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours.
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
Your worth, your greatness, and nobility.
</HUBERT>
<BIGOT>	<77%>
Out, dunghill! dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
</BIGOT>
<HUBERT>	<77%>
Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor.
</HUBERT>
<SALISBURY>	<77%>
Thou art a murderer.
</SALISBURY>
<HUBERT>	<77%>
Do not prove me so;
Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
</HUBERT>
<PEMBROKE>	<77%>
Cut him to pieces.
</PEMBROKE>
<BASTARD>	<77%>
Keep the peace, I say.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<77%>
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
</SALISBURY>
<BASTARD>	<77%>
Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime:
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
</BASTARD>
<BIGOT>	<77%>
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
Second a villain and a murderer?
</BIGOT>
<HUBERT>	<77%>
Lord Bigot, I am none.
</HUBERT>
<BIGOT>	<77%>
Who kill'd this prince?
</BIGOT>
<HUBERT>	<78%>
'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
I honour'd him, I lov'd him; and will weep
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
</HUBERT>
<SALISBURY>	<78%>
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
For villany is not without such rheum;
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
</SALISBURY>
<BIGOT>	<78%>
Away toward Bury; to the Dauphin there!
</BIGOT>
<PEMBROKE>	<78%>
There tell the king he may inquire us out.
</PEMBROKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lords.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BASTARD>	<78%>
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<78%>
Do but hear me, sir.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<78%>
Ha! I'll tell thee what;
Thou art damn'd as black—nay, nothing is so black;
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<78%>
Upon my soul,—
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<78%>
If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act, do but despair;
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
Put but a little water in a spoon,
And it shall be as all the ocean,
Enough to stifle such a villain up.
I do suspect thee very grievously.
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<79%>
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
I left him well.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<79%>
Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amaz'd, methinks, and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
The life, the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unow'd interest of proud swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest,
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,—
As doth a raven on a sick-fallen beast,—
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
Now happy he whose cloak and ceinture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

<The Same. A Room in the Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter King John, Pandulph with the crown, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<80%>
Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory.
</K. JOHN>
<PANDULPH>	<80%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Giving John the crown.>
</STAGE DIR> Take again
From this my hand, as holding of the pope,
Your sovereign greatness and authority.
</PANDULPH>
<K. JOHN>	<80%>
Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
And from his holiness use all your power
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflam'd.
Our discontented counties do revolt,
Our people quarrel with obedience,
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
This inundation of mistemper'd humour
Rests by you only to be qualified:
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
That present medicine must be minister'd,
Or overthrow incurable ensues.
</K. JOHN>
<PANDULPH>	<80%>
It was my breath that blew this tempest up
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
But since you are a gentle convertite,
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
And make fair weather in your blustering land.
On this Ascension-day, remember well,
Upon your oath of service to the pope,
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
</PANDULPH>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<81%>
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
I did suppose it should be on constraint;
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
</K. JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BASTARD>	<81%>
All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
But Dover Castle: London hath receiv'd,
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
To offer service to your enemy;
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<81%>
Would not my lords return to me again
After they heard young Arthur was alive?
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<81%>
They found him dead and cast into the streets,
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<81%>
That villain Hubert told me he did live.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<81%>
So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
Threaten the threatener, and outface the brow
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
That borrow their behaviours from the great,
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
Away! and glister like the god of war
When he intendeth to become the field:
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What! shall they seek the lion in his den
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
O! let it not be said. Forage, and run
To meet displeasure further from the doors,
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<82%>
The legate of the pope hath been with me,
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<82%>
O inglorious league!
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
Insinuation, parley and base truce
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
And flesh his spirit in a war-like soul,
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms:
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
Or if he do, let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<83%>
Have thou the ordering of this present time.
</K. JOHN>

Away then, with good courage! yet, I know,
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.

<LEWIS>	<83%>
My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
And keep it safe for our remembrance.
Return the precedent to these lords again;
That, having our fair order written down,
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
May know wherefore we took the sacrament,
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
</LEWIS>
<SALISBURY>	<83%>
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
A voluntary zeal, an unurg'd faith
To your proceedings; yet, believe me, prince,
I am not glad that such a sore of time
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
By making many. O! it grieves my soul
That I must draw this metal from my side
To be a widow-maker! O! and there
Where honourable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury.
But such is the infection of the time,
That, for the health and physic of our right,
We cannot deal but with the very hand
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends!
That we, the sons and children of this isle,
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
Wherein we step after a stranger march
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
Her enemies' ranks,—I must withdraw and weep
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,—
To grace the gentry of a land remote,
And follow unacquainted colours here?
What, here? O nation! that thou couldst remove;
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
And gripple thee unto a pagan shore;
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league,
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
</SALISBURY>
<LEWIS>	<84%>
A noble temper dost thou show in this;
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Do make an earthquake of nobility.
O! what a noble combat hast thou fought
Between compulsion and a brave respect.
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
Being an ordinary inundation;
But this effusion of such manly drops,
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amaz'd
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors.
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
And with a great heart heave away this storm:
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
That never saw the giant world enrag'd;
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Pandulph attended.>
</STAGE DIR>
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,
And on our actions set the name of right
</LEWIS>
With holy breath.
<PANDULPH>	<85%>
Hail, noble prince of France!
The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in
That so stood out against the holy church,
The great metropolis and see of Rome.
Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up,
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
That, like a lion foster'd up at hand,
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
And be no further harmful than in show.
</PANDULPH>
<LEWIS>	<85%>
Your grace shall pardon me; I will not back:
I am too high-born to be propertied,
To be a secondary at control,
Or useful serving-man and instrument
To any sovereign state throughout the world.
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself,
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
You taught me how to know the face of right,
Acquainted me with interest to this land,
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
And come you now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
What men provided, what munition sent,
To underprop this action? is't not I
That undergo this charge? who else but I,
And such as to my claim are liable,
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
Have I not heard these islanders shout out,
Vive le roy! as I have bank'd their towns?
Have I not here the best cards for the game
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
</LEWIS>
<PANDULPH>	<87%>
You look but on the outside of this work.
</PANDULPH>
<LEWIS>	<87%>
Outside or inside, I will not return
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war,
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
To outlook conquest and to win renown
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
<STAGE DIR>

According to the fair play of the world,
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
My holy Lord of Milan, from the king
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue.
</BASTARD>
<PANDULPH>	<87%>
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
And will not temporize with my entreaties:
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
</PANDULPH>
<BASTARD>	<87%>
By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepar'd; and reason too he should:
This apish and unmannerly approach,
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
The king doth smile at; and is well prepar'd
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
From out the circle of his territories.
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch;
To dive, like buckets, in concealed wells;
To crouch in litter of your stable planks:
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks;
To hug with swine; to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons; and to thrill and shake,
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
Thinking this voice an armed Englishman:
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
No! Know, the gallant monarch is in arms,
And like an eagle o'er his aiery towers,
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame:
For your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
Their neelds to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.
</BASTARD>
<LEWIS>	<88%>
There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.
</LEWIS>
<PANDULPH>	<89%>
Give me leave to speak.
</PANDULPH>
<BASTARD>	<89%>
No, I will speak.
</BASTARD>
<LEWIS>	<89%>
We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.
</LEWIS>
<BASTARD>	<89%>
Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
Sound but another, and another shall
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,—
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need,—
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
</BASTARD>
<LEWIS>	<89%>
Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.

Be of good comfort: for the great supply

Are wrack'd three nights ago on Goodwin sands.
This news was brought to Richard but even now.

<MELUN>	<91%>
Fly, noble English; you are bought and sold;
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,
And I with him, and many moe with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.
</MELUN>
<SALISBURY>	<91%>
May this be possible? may this be true?
</SALISBURY>
<MELUN>	<91%>
Have I not hideous death within my view,
Retaining but a quantity of life,
Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
Why should I then be false, since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
Behold another day break in the east:
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
Commend me to one Hubert with your king;
The love of him, and this respect besides,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace, and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires.
</MELUN>
<SALISBURY>	<92%>
We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favour and the form
Of this most fair occasion, by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight,
And like a bated and retired flood,
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,
And calmly run on in obedience,
Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
And happy newness, that intends old right.

<The Same. The French Camp.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lewis and his Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEWIS>	<93%>
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
When the English measur'd backward their own ground
In faint retire. O! bravely came we off,
When with a volley of our needless shot,
After such bloody toil, we bid good night,
And wound our tottering colours clearly up,
Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
</LEWIS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER>	<93%>
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
</MESSENGER>
<LEWIS>	<93%>
Here: what news?
</LEWIS>
<MESSENGER>	<93%>
The Count Melun is slain; the English lords,
By his persuasion, are again fall'n off;
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
Are cast away and sunk, on Goodwin sands.
</MESSENGER>
<LEWIS>	<93%>
Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
I did not think to be so sad to-night
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
</LEWIS>
<MESSENGER>	<93%>
Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
</MESSENGER>
<LEWIS>	<93%>
Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
The day shall not be up so soon as I,
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.

<An open Place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Bastard and Hubert, severally.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
A friend. What art thou?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
Of the part of England.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
Whither dost thou go?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
What's that to thee? Why may not I demand
Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine?
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
Hubert, I think?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
Thou hast a perfect thought:
I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
Who art thou?
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets.
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
To find you out.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
Brief, then; and what's the news?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<94%>
O! my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<94%>
Show me the very wound of this ill news:
I am no woman; I'll not swound at it.
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<95%>
The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
I left him almost speechless; and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time
Than if you had at leisure known of this.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<95%>
How did he take it? who did taste to him?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<95%>
A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<95%>
Whom didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
</BASTARD>
<HUBERT>	<95%>
Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
And brought Prince Henry in their company;
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
And they are all about his majesty.
</HUBERT>
<BASTARD>	<95%>
Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them:
Myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
Away before! conduct me to the king;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.

<The Orchard of Swinstead Abbey.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Prince Henry, Salisbury, and Bigot.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<95%>
It is too late: the life of all his blood
Is touch'd corruptibly; and his pure brain,—
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,—
Doth, by the idle comments that it makes,
Foretell the ending of mortality.
</PRINCE HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Pembroke.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PEMBROKE>	<96%>
His highness yet doth speak; and holds belief
That, being brought into the open air,
It would allay the burning quality
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
</PEMBROKE>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<96%>
Let him be brought into the orchard here.
Doth he still rage?
</PRINCE HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Bigot.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PEMBROKE>	<96%>
He is more patient
Than when you left him: even now he sung.
</PEMBROKE>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<96%>
O, vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
In their continuance will not feel themselves.
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
Leaves them invisible; and his siege is now
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
With many legions of strange fantasies,
Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing.
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
His soul and body to their lasting rest
</PRINCE HENRY>
<SALISBURY>	<96%>
Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
</SALISBURY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Bigot and Attendants carrying King John in a chair.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
It would not out at windows, nor at doors.
There is so hot a summer in my bosom
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment, and against this fire
Do I shrink up.
</K. JOHN>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<97%>
How fares your majesty?
</PRINCE HENRY>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
Poison'd, ill-fare; dead, forsook, cast off;
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw;
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
Through my burn'd bosom; nor entreat the north
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much:
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
And so ingrateful you deny me that.
</K. JOHN>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<97%>
O! that there were some virtue in my tears,
That might relieve you.
</PRINCE HENRY>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
The salt in them is hot.
Within me is a hell; and there the poison
Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood.
</K. JOHN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BASTARD>	<97%>
O! I am scalded with my violent motion
And spleen of speed to see your majesty.
</BASTARD>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
O cousin! thou art come to set mine eye:
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
Are turned to one thread, one little hair;
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty.
</K. JOHN>
<BASTARD>	<98%>
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
Where heaven he knows how we shall answer him:
For in a night the best part of my power,
As I upon advantage did remove,
Were in the Washes all unwarily
Devoured by the unexpected flood.
</BASTARD>
<STAGE DIR>
<The King dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SALISBURY>	<98%>
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
My liege! my lord! But now a king, now thus.
</SALISBURY>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<98%>
Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
When this was now a king, and now is clay?
</PRINCE HENRY>
<BASTARD>	<98%>
Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge,
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
Now, now, you stars, that move in your right spheres,
Where be your powers? Show now your mended faiths,
And instantly return with me again,
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought:
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<99%>
It seems you know not then so much as we.
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
And brings from him such offers of our peace
As we with honour and respect may take,
With purpose presently to leave this war.
</SALISBURY>
<BASTARD>	<99%>
He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<99%>
Nay, it is in a manner done already;
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
To the disposing of the cardinal:
With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,
If you think meet, this afternoon will post
To consummate this business happily.
</SALISBURY>
<BASTARD>	<99%>
Let it be so. And you, my noble prince,
With other princes that may best be spar'd,
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
</BASTARD>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<99%>
At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
For so he will'd it.
</PRINCE HENRY>
<BASTARD>	<99%>
Thither shall it then.
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land!
To whom, with all submission, on my knee,
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly.
</BASTARD>
<SALISBURY>	<99%>
And the like tender of our love we make,
To rest without a spot for evermore.
</SALISBURY>
<PRINCE HENRY>	<100%>
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
And knows not how to do it but with tears.
</PRINCE HENRY>
<BASTARD>	<100%>
O! let us pay the time but needful woe
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
This England never did, nor never shall,
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
But when it first did help to wound itself.
Now these her princes are come home again,
Come the three corners of the world in arms,
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
If England to itself do rest but true.
