A Pit - but Heaven over it -
And Heaven beside, and Heaven abroad;
And yet a Pit -
With Heaven over it.
To stir would be to slip -
To look would be to drop -
To dream - to sap the Prop
That holds my chances up.
Ah! Pit! With Heaven over it!
The depth is all my thought -
I dare not ask my feet -
'Twould start us where we sit
So straight you'd scarce suspect
It was a Pit - with fathoms under it
Circuit just the same
Whose Doom to whom
'Twould start them -
We - could tremble -
But since we got a Bomb -
And held it in our Bosom -
Nay - Hold it - it is calm -
