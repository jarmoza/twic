The nearest Dream recedes - unrealized -
The Heaven we chase -
Like the June Bee - before the School Boy -
Invites the Race -
Stoops - to an easy Clover -
Dips - evades - teazes - deploys -
Then - to the Royal Clouds
Lifts his light Pinnace -
Heedless of the Boy -
Staring - bewildered - at the mocking sky -
Homesick for steadfast Honey -
Ah - the Bee flies not
That brews that rare variety!
