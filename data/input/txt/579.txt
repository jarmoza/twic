Like some Old fashioned Miracle
When Summertime is done -
Seems Summer's Recollection
And the Affairs of June
As infinite Tradition
As Cinderella's Bays -
Or Little John - of Lincoln Green -
Or Blue Beard's Galleries -
Her Bees have a fictitious Hum -
Her Blossoms, like a Dream -
Elate us - till we almost weep -
So plausible - they seem -
Her Memories like Strains - Review -
When Orchestra is dumb -
The Violin in Baize replaced -
And Ear - and Heaven - numb -
