I prayed, at first, a little Girl,
Because they told me to -
But stopped, when qualified to guess
How prayer would feel - to me -
If I believed God looked around,
Each time my Childish eye
Fixed full, and steady, on his own
In Childish honesty -
And told him what I'd like, today,
And parts of his far plan
That baffled me -
The mingled side
Of his Divinity -
And often since, in Danger,
I count the force 'twould be
To have a God so strong as that
To hold my life for me
Till I could take the Balance
That tips so frequent, now,
It takes me all the while to poise -
And then - it does'nt stay -
