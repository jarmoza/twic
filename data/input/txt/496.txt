'Tis so appalling - it exhilirates -
So over Horror, it half captivates -
The Soul stares after it, secure -
To know the worst, leaves no dread more -
To scan a Ghost, is faint -
But grappling, conquers it -
How easy, Torment, now -
Suspense kept sawing so -
The Truth, is Bald - and Cold -
But that will hold -
If any are not sure -
We show them - prayer -
But we, who know,
Stop hoping, now -
Looking at Death, is Dying -
Just let go the Breath -
And not the pillow at your cheek
So slumbereth -
Others, can wrestle -
Your's, is done -
And so of Wo, bleak dreaded - come,
It sets the Fright at liberty -
And Terror's free -
Gay, Ghastly, Holiday!
