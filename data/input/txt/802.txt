I'm sorry for the Dead - Today -
It's such congenial times
Old neighbors have at fences -
It's time o'year for Hay,
And Broad - Sunburned
Discourse between the Toil -
And laugh, a homely species
That makes the Fences smile -
It seems so straight to lie away
From all the noise of Fields -
The Busy Carts - the fragrant Cocks -
The Mower's metre - Steals
A Trouble lest homesick -
Those Farmers - and their Wives -
Set separate from the Farming -
And all the Neighbor's lives -
A Wonder if the Sepulchre
Dont feel a lonesome way -
When Men - and Boys - and  Carts - and June,
Go down the Fields to "Hay" -
