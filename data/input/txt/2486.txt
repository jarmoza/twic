Morns like these -- we parted --
Noons like these -- she rose --
Fluttering first -- then firmer
To her fair repose.
Never did she lisp it --
It was not for me --
She -- was mute from transport --
I -- from agony --
Till -- the evening nearing
One the curtains drew --
Quick! A Sharper rustling!
And this linnet flew!
