Publication - is the Auction
Of the Mind of Man -
Poverty - be justifying
For so foul a thing
Possibly - but We - would rather
From Our Garret go
White - unto the White Creator -
Than invest - Our Snow -
Thought belong to Him who gave it -
Then - to Him Who bear
It's Corporeal illustration - sell
The Royal Air -
In the Parcel - Be the Merchant
Of the Heavenly Grace -
But reduce no Human Spirit
To Disgrace of Price -
