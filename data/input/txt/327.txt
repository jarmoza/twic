He was weak, and I was strong - then -
So He let me lead him in -
I was weak, and He was strong then -
So I let him lead me - Home.
'Twas'nt far - the door was near -
'Twas'nt dark - for He went - too -
'Twas'nt loud, for He said nought -
That was all I cared to know.
Day knocked - and we must part -
Neither - was strongest - now -
He strove - and I strove - too -
We did'nt do it - tho'!
