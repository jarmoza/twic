It's thoughts -- and just One Heart --
And Old Sunshine -- about --
Make frugal -- Ones -- Content --
And two or three -- for Company --
Upon a Holiday --
Crowded -- as Sacrament --
Books -- when the Unit --
Spare the Tenant -- long eno' --
A Picture -- if it Care --
Itself -- a Gallery too rare --
For needing more --
Flowers -- to keep the Eyes -- from going awkward --
When it snows --
A Bird -- if they -- prefer --
Though Winter fire -- sing clear as Plover
To our -- ear --
A Landscape -- not so great
To suffocate the Eye --
A Hill -- perhaps --
Perhaps -- the profile of a Mill
Turned by the Wind --
Tho' such -- are luxuries --
It's thoughts -- and just two Heart --
And Heaven -- about --
At least -- a Counterfeit --
We would not have Correct --
And Immortality -- can be almost --
Not quite -- Content --
