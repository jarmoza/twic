A House opon the Hight -
That Wagon never reached -
No Dead, were ever carried down -
No Peddler's Cart - approached -
Whose Chimney never smoked -
Whose Windows - Night and Morn -
Caught Sunrise first - and Sunset - last -
Then - held an Empty Pane -
Whose fate - Conjecture knew -
No other neighbor - did -
And what was - we never lisped -
Because He - never told -
