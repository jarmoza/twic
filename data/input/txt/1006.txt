I think To Live - may be a Bliss
To those who dare to try -
Beyond my limit - to conceive -
My lip - to testify -
I think the Heart I former wore
Could widen - till to me
The Other, like the little Bank
Appear - unto the Sea -
I think the Days - could every one
In Ordination stand -
And Majesty - be easier -
Than an inferior kind -
No numb alarm - lest Difference come -
No Goblin - on the Bloom -
No start in Apprehension's Ear,
No Bankruptcy - no Doom -
But Certainties of Sun -
Midsummer - in the Mind -
A steadfast South - opon the Soul -
Her Polar time - behind -
The Vision - pondered long -
So plausible becomes
That I esteem the fiction -  real -
The Real - fictitious seems -
How bountiful the Dream -
What Plenty - it would be
Had all my Life but been Mistake
Just rectified - in Thee
