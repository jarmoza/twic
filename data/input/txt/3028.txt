We learned the Whole of Love --
The Alphabet -- the Words --
A Chapter -- then the mighty Book --
Then -- Revelation closed --
But in Each Other's eyes
An Ignorance beheld --
Diviner than the Childhood's --
And each to each, a Child --
Attempted to expound
What Neither -- understood --
Alas, that Wisdom is so large --
And Truth -- so manifold!
