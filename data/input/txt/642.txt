"Why do I love" You, Sir?
Because -
The Wind does not require the Grass
To answer - Wherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place.
Because He knows - and
Do not You -
And We know not -
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so -
The Lightning - never asked an Eye
Wherefore it shut - when He was by -
Because He knows it cannot speak -
And reasons not -
There be - preferred by Daintier Folk -
The Sunrise - Sir - compelleth Me -
Because He's Sunrise - and I see -
Therefore - Then -
I love Thee -
