If Anybody's friend be dead
It's sharpest of the theme
The thinking how they walked alive -
At such and such a time -
Their costume, of a Sunday,
Some manner of the Hair -
A prank nobody knew but them
Lost, in the Sepulchre -
How warm, they were, on such a day,
You almost feel the date -
So short way off it seems -
And now - they're Centuries from that -
How pleased they were, at what you said!
You try to touch the smile
And dip your fingers in the frost -
When was it - Can you tell -
You asked the Company to tea -
Acquaintance - just a few -
And chatted close with this Grand Thing
That dont remember you -
Past Bows, and Invitations -
Past Interview, and Vow -
Past what Ourself can estimate -
That - makes the Quick of Wo!
