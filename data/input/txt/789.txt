It was a quiet way -
He asked if I was his -
I made no answer of the Tongue
But answer of the Eyes -
And then He bore me on
Before this mortal noise
With swiftness, as of Chariots
And distance, as of Wheels -
This World did drop away
As Acres from the feet
Of one that leaneth from Balloon
Opon an Ether street.
The Gulf behind was not,
The Continents were new -
Eternity it was before
Eternity was due -
No Seasons were to us -
It was not Night nor Morn -
But Sunrise stopped opon the place
And fastened it in Dawn -
