It's thoughts - and just One Heart -
And Old Sunshine - about -
Make frugal - Ones - Content -
And two or three - for Company -
Opon a Holiday -
Crowded - as Sacrament -
Books - when the Unit -
Spare the Tenant - long eno' -
A Picture - if it Care -
Itself - a Gallery too rare -
For needing more -
Flowers - to keep the eyes - from going awkward -
When it snows -
A Bird - if they - prefer -
Though winter fire - sing clear as Plover -
To our - ear -
A Landscape - not so great
To suffocate the eye -
A Hill - perhaps -
Perhaps - the profile of a Mill
Turned by the wind -
Tho' - are -
It's thoughts - and just two Heart -
And Heaven - about -
At least - a Counterfeit -
We would not have Correct -
And Immortality - can be almost -
Not quite - Content -
