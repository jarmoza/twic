Of Bronze -- and Blaze --
The North -- Tonight --
So adequate -- it forms --
So preconcerted with itself
So distant -- to alarms --
An Unconcern so sovreign
To Universe, or me --
Infects my simple spirit
With Taints of Majesty --
Till I take vaster attitudes --
And strut upon my stem --
Disdaining Men, and Oxygen,
For Arrogance of them --
My Splendors, are Menagerie --
But their Competeless Show
Will entertain the Centuries
When I, am long ago,
An Island in dishonored Grass --
Whom none but Daisies, know.
