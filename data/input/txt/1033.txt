Remorse - is Memory - awake -
Her Parties all astir -
A Presence of Departed Acts -
At window - and at Door -
It's Past - set down before the Soul
And lighted with a match -
Perusal - to facilitate -
And help Belief to stretch -
Remorse is cureless - the Disease
Not even God - can heal -
For 'tis His institution - and
The Adequate of Hell -
