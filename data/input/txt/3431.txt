Robbed by Death -- but that was easy --
To the  failing Eye
I could hold the latest Glowing --
Robbed by Liberty
For Her Jugular Defences --
This, too, I endured --
Hint of Glory -- it afforded --
For the Brave Beloved --
Fraud of Distance -- Fraud of Danger,
Fraud of Death -- to bear --
It is Bounty -- to Suspense's
Vague Calamity --
Staking our entire Possession
On a Hair's result --
Then -- Seesawing -- coolly -- on it --
Trying if it split --
