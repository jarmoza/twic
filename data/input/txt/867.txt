Had I presumed to hope -
The loss had been to Me
A Value - for the Greatness' Sake -
As Giants - gone away -
Had I presumed to gain
A Favor so remote -
The Failure but confirm the Grace
In further Infinite -
'Tis failure - not of Hope -
But Confident Despair -
Advancing on Celestial Lists -
With faint - Terrestrial power -
'Tis Honor - though I die -
For That no Man obtain
Till He be justified by Death -
This - is the Second Gain -
