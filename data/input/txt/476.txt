There came a Day at Summer's full,
Entirely for me -
I thought that such were for the Saints,
Where Resurrections - be -
The Sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new -
The time was scarce profaned, by speech -
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at Sacrament,
The Wardrobe, of our Lord -
Each was to each The Sealed Church,
Permitted to commune this - time -
Lest we too awkward show
At supper of the Lamb.
The Hours slid fast - as Hours will,
Clutched tight, by greedy hands -
So faces on two Decks, look back,
Bound to opposing lands -
And so when all the time had leaked,
Without external sound
Each bound the Other's Crucifix -
We gave no other Bond -
Sufficient Troth, that we shall rise -
Deposed - at length, the Grave -
To that new Marriage,
Justified - through Calvaries - of Love -
