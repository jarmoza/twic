I know a place where Summer strives
With such a practised Frost -
She - each year - leads her Daisies back -
Recording briefly - "Lost" -
But when the South Wind stirs the Pools
And struggles in the lanes -
Her Heart misgives Her, for Her Vow -
And she pours soft Refrains
Into the lap of Adamant -
And spices - and the Dew -
That stiffens quietly to Quartz -
Opon her Amber Shoe -
