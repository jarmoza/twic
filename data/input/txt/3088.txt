They called me to the Window, for
"'Twas Sunset" -- Some one said --
I only saw a Sapphire Farm --
And just a Single Herd
Of Opal Cattle -- feeding far
Upon so vain a Hill --
As even while I looked -- dissolved --
Nor Cattle were -- nor Soil --
But in their Room -- a Sea -- displayed --
And Ships -- of such a size
As Crew of Mountains -- could afford --
And Decks -- to seat the skies --
This -- too -- the Showman rubbed away --
And when I looked again --
Nor Farm -- nor Opal Herd -- was there --
Nor Mediterranean --
3.a Sapphire] an Amber --
