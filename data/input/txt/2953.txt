The World -- stands -- solemner -- to me --
Since I was wed -- to Him --
A modesty befits the soul
That bears another's -- name --
A doubt -- if it be fair -- indeed --
To wear that perfect -- pearl --
The Man -- upon the Woman -- binds --
To clasp her soul -- for all --
A prayer, that it more angel -- prove --
A whiter Gift -- within --
To that munificence, that chose --
So unadorned -- a Queen --
A Gratitude -- that such be true --
It had esteemed the Dream --
Too beautiful -- for Shape to prove --
Or posture -- to redeem!
