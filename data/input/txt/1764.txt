While we were fearing it, it came -
But came with less of fear
Because that fearing it so long
Had almost made it fair -
There is a Fitting - a Dismay -
A Fitting - a Despair -
'Tis harder knowing it is Due
Than knowing it is Here.
The Trying on the Utmost
The Morning it is New
Is terribler than wearing it
A whole existence through -
