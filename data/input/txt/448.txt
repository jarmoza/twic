What if I say I shall not wait!
What if I burst the fleshly Gate -
And pass Escaped - to thee!
What if I file this mortal - off -
See where it hurt me - That's enough -
And step in Liberty!
They cannot take me - any more!
Dungeons can call - and Guns implore -
Unmeaning - now - to me -
As laughter - was - an hour ago -
Or Laces - or a Travelling Show -
Or who died - yesterday!
