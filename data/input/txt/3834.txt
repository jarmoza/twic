A Saucer holds a Cup
In sordid -- human Life
But in a Squirrel's estimate
A Saucer holds a Loaf.
A Table of a Tree
Demands the little King
And every Breeze that run along
His Dining Room do swing.
His Cutlery -- he keeps
Within his Russet Lips --
To see it flashing when he dines
Do Birmingham eclipse --
Convicted -- could we be
Of our Minutiae
The smallest Citizen that flies
Is heartier than we --
