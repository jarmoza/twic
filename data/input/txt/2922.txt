Why make it doubt -- it hurts it so --
So sick -- to guess --
So strong -- to know --
So brave -- upon it's little Bed
To tell the very last They said
Unto Itself -- and smile -- And shake --
For that dear -- distant -- dangerous -- Sake --
But -- the Instead -- the Pinching fear
That Something -- it did do -- or dare --
Offend the Vision -- and it flee --
And They no more remember me --
Nor ever turn to tell me why --
Oh, Master, This is Misery --
