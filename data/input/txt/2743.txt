A Mien to move a Queen --
Half Child -- Half Heroine --
An Orleans in the Eye
That puts it's manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a Tear --
It's frequent Visitor --
A Bonnet like a Duke --
And yet a Wren's Peruke
Were not so shy
Of Goer by --
And Hands -- so slight --
They would elate a Sprite
With Merriment --
A Voice that Alters -- Low
And on the Ear can go
Like Let of Snow --
Or shift supreme --
As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem --
Too small -- to fear --
Too distant -- to endear --
And so Men Compromise --
And just -- revere --
