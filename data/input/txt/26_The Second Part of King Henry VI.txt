As by your high imperial majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France,
As procurator to your excellence,
To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace;
So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Britaine, and Alençon,
Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,
I have perform'd my task, and was espous'd:
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
In sight of England and her lordly peers,
Deliver up my title in the queen
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
Of that great shadow I did represent;
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd.
</SUFFOLK>
<K. HENRY>	<1%>
Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
I can express no kinder sign of love
Than this kind kiss. O Lord! that lends me life,
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
</K. HENRY>
<Q. MARGARET>	<1%>
Great King of England and my gracious lord,
The mutual conference that my mind hath had
By day, by night, waking, and in my dreams,
In courtly company, or at my beads,
With you, mine alderliefest sovereign,
Makes me the bolder to salute my king
With ruder terms, such as my wit affords,
And over-joy of heart doth minister.
</Q. MARGARET>
<K. HENRY>	<1%>
Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
</K. HENRY>
<ALL>	<1%>
Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!
</ALL>
<Q. MARGARET>	<2%>
We thank you all.

<SUFFOLK>	<2%>
My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,
Here are the articles of contracted peace
Between our sovereign and the French King Charles,
For eighteen months concluded by consent.
</SUFFOLK>
<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
Imprimis, It is agreed between the French king, Charles, and William De la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia, and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing.
Item, That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father.—
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Lets the paper fall.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. HENRY>	<2%>
Uncle, how now!
</K. HENRY>
<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
Pardon me, gracious lord;
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
</GLOUCESTER>
<K. HENRY>	<2%>
Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
</K. HENRY>
<CARDINAL>	<2%>
Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father; and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.
</CARDINAL>
<K. HENRY>	<2%>
They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:
We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,
And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
We here discharge your Grace from being regent
I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
Be full expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
Salisbury, and Warwick;
We thank you all for this great favour done,
In entertainment to my princely queen.
Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
To see her coronation be perform'd.
</K. HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt King, Queen, and Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
His valour, coin, and people, in the wars?
Did he so often lodge in open field,
In winter's cold, and summer's parching heat,
To conquer France, his true inheritance?
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
To keep by policy what Henry got?
Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy?
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
With all the learned council of the realm,
Studied so long, sat in the council-house
Early and late, debating to and fro
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe?
And hath his highness in his infancy
Been crown'd in Paris, in despite of foes?
And shall these labours and these honours die?
Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
O peers of England! shameful is this league,
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
Blotting your names from books of memory,
Razing the characters of your renown,
Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
Undoing all, as all had never been.
</GLOUCESTER>
<CARDINAL>	<3%>
Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
This peroration with such circumstance?
For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
</CARDINAL>
<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
Ay, uncle; we will keep it, if we can;
But now it is impossible we should.
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
Hath given the duchies of Anjou and Maine
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
</GLOUCESTER>
<SALISBURY>	<4%>
Now, by the death of him who died for all,
These counties were the keys of Normandy.
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
</SALISBURY>
<WARWICK>	<4%>
For grief that they are past recovery:
For, were there hope to conquer them again,
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
And are the cities, that I got with wounds,
Deliver'd up again with peaceful words?
Mort Dieu!
</WARWICK>
<YORK>	<4%>
For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
That dims the honour of this war-like isle!
France should have torn and rent my very heart
Before I would have yielded to this league.
I never read but England's kings have had
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;
And our King Henry gives away his own,
To match with her that brings no vantages.
</YORK>
<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
A proper jest, and never heard before,
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
For costs and charges in transporting her!
She should have stay'd in France, and starv'd in France,
Before—
</GLOUCESTER>
<CARDINAL>	<4%>
My Lord of Gloucester, now you grow too hot:
It was the pleasure of my lord the king.
</CARDINAL>
<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind:
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
I see thy fury. If I longer stay
We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CARDINAL>	<5%>
So, there goes our protector in a rage.
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
Consider lords, he is the next of blood,
And heir apparent to the English crown:
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.
Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words
Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
What though the common people favour him,
Calling him, 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester;'
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
He will be found a dangerous protector.
</CARDINAL>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<5%>
Why should he then protect our sovereign,
He being of age to govern of himself?
Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<CARDINAL>	<5%>
This weighty business will not brook delay;
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
</CARDINAL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SOMERSET>	<5%>
Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
And greatness of his place be grief to us,
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
His insolence is more intolerable
Than all the princes in the land beside:
If Gloucester be displac'd, he'll be protector.
</SOMERSET>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<6%>
Or thou, or I, Somerset, will be protector,
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SALISBURY>	<6%>
Pride went before, ambition follows him.
While these do labour for their own preferment,
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
I never saw but Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal
More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy house-keeping,
Have won the greatest favour of the commons,
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
In bringing them to civil discipline,
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people.
Join we together for the public good,
In what we can to bridle and suppress
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
While they do tend the profit of the land.
</SALISBURY>
<WARWICK>	<6%>
So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
And common profit of his country!
</WARWICK>
<YORK>	<6%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
</YORK>
<SALISBURY>	<6%>
Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
</SALISBURY>
<WARWICK>	<7%>
Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost!
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
And would have kept so long as breath did last:
Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
Which I will win from France, or else be slain.
</WARWICK>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YORK>	<7%>
Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.
Suffolk concluded on the articles,
The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleas'd
To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,
And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
While as the silly owner of the goods
Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands,
And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof,
While all is shar'd and all is borne away,
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
As did the fatal brand Althæa burn'd
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit.
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right.
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
Whose church-like humours fit not for a crown.
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
To pry into the secrets of the state;
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd,
And in my standard bear the arms of York,
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.

<The Same. A Room in the Duke of Gloucester's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester and his Duchess.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DUCHESS>	<8%>
Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
As frowning at the favours of the world?
Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth,
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem
Enchas'd with all the honours of the world?
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
Until thy head be circled with the same.
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold:
What! is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine;
And having both together heav'd it up,
We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
And never more abase our sight so low
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
</DUCHESS>
<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts:
And may that thought, when I imagine ill
Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
</GLOUCESTER>
<DUCHESS>	<9%>
What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it
With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
</DUCHESS>
<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;
And on the pieces of the broken wand
Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
And William De la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.
</GLOUCESTER>
<DUCHESS>	<9%>
Tut! this was nothing but an argument
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
Shall lose his head for his presumption.
But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
Methought I sat in seat of majesty
In the cathedral church of Westminster,
And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;
Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me,
And on my head did set the diadem.
</DUCHESS>
<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:
Presumptuous dame! ill-nurtur'd Eleanor!
Art thou not second woman in the realm,
And the protector's wife, belov'd of him?
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
To tumble down thy husband and thyself
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
Away from me, and let me hear no more.
</GLOUCESTER>
<DUCHESS>	<10%>
What, what, my lord! are you so choleric
With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,
And not be check'd.
</DUCHESS>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
Nay, be not angry; I am pleas'd again.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER>	<10%>
My Lord Protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,
Whereas the king and queen do mean to hawk.
</MESSENGER>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
</GLOUCESTER>
<DUCHESS>	<10%>
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Gloucester and Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
Follow I must; I cannot go before,
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
And, being a woman, I will not be slack
To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,
We are alone; here's none but thee and I.
</DUCHESS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hume.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HUME>	<10%>
Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
</HUME>
<DUCHESS>	<10%>
What sayst thou? majesty! I am but Grace.
</DUCHESS>
<HUME>	<10%>
But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,
Your Grace's title shall be multiplied.
</HUME>
<DUCHESS>	<10%>
What sayst thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd
With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?
And will they undertake to do me good?
</DUCHESS>
<HUME>	<10%>
This they have promised, to show your highness
A spirit rais'd from depth of under ground,
That shall make answer to such questions
As by your Grace shall be propounded him.
</HUME>
<DUCHESS>	<11%>
It is enough: I'll think upon the questions.
When from Saint Alban's we do make return
We'll see these things effected to the full.
Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,
With thy confed'rates in this weighty cause.
</DUCHESS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HUME>	<11%>
Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
Marry and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
The business asketh silent secrecy.
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
Yet have I gold flies from another coast:
I dare not say from the rich cardinal
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
Yet I do find it so: for, to be plain,
They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
Have hired me to undermine the duchess
And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
They say, 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wrack,
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall.
Sort how it will I shall have gold for all.

<Q. MARGARET>	<13%>
My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
Is this the fashion of the court of England?
Is this the government of Britain's isle,
And this the royalty of Albion's king?
What! shall King Henry be a pupil still
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
Am I a queen in title and in style,
And must be made a subject to a duke?
I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love,
And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
I thought King Henry had resembled thee
In courage, courtship, and proportion:
But all his mind is bent to holiness,
To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
His champions are the prophets and apostles;
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ;
His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
Are brazen images of canoniz'd saints.
I would the college of the cardinals
Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,
And set the triple crown upon his head:
That were a state fit for his holiness.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<13%>
Madam, be patient; as I was cause
Your highness came to England, so will I
In England work your Grace's full content.
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<13%>
Beside the haught protector, have we Beaufort
The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
And grumbling York; and not the least of these
But can do more in England than the king.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<14%>
And he of these that can do most of all
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<14%>
Not all these lords do vex me half so much
As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife:
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife.
Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
And in her heart she scorns our poverty.
Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her?
Contemptuous base-born callot as she is,
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day
The very train of her worst wearing gown
Was better worth than all my father's lands,
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<14%>
Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
That she will light to listen to the lays,
And never mount to trouble you again.
So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;
For I am bold to counsel you in this.
Although we fancy not the cardinal,
Yet must we join with him and with the lords
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
Will make but little for his benefit:
So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

<SALISBURY>	<15%>
Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,
Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this.
</SALISBURY>
<Q. MARGARET>	<15%>
Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.
</Q. MARGARET>
<GLOUCESTER>	<15%>
Madam, the king is old enough himself
To give his censure: these are no women's matters.

<Q. MARGARET>	<15%>
If he be old enough, what needs your Grace
To be protector of his excellence?
</Q. MARGARET>
<GLOUCESTER>	<15%>
Madam, I am protector of the realm;

Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
Since thou wertking,—as who is king but thou?—
The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack;
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
</SUFFOLK>
<CARDINAL>	<15%>
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

<SOMERSET>	<15%>
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury.

<BUCKINGHAM>	<15%>
Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders hath exceeded law,
And left thee to the mercy of the law.

<Q. MARGARET>	<16%>
Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
If they were known, as the suspect is great,
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.

Was't I? yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:
Could I come near your beauty with my nails
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.

<K. HENRY>	<16%>
Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
</K. HENRY>
<DUCHESS>	<16%>
Against her will! Good king, look to't in time;
She'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby:
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd.
</DUCHESS>

Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,

<GLOUCESTER>	<16%>
Now, lords, my choler being over-blown
With walking once about the quadrangle,
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
As for your spiteful false objections,
Prove them, and I lie open to the law:
But God in mercy so deal with my soul
As I in duty love my king and country!
But to the matter that we have in hand.
I say, my sov'reign, York is meetest man
To be your regent in the realm of France.
</GLOUCESTER>
<SUFFOLK>	<16%>
Before we make election, give me leave
To show some reason, of no little force,
That York is most unmeet of any man.
</SUFFOLK>
<YORK>	<17%>
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
Next, if I be appointed for the place,
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
Without discharge, money, or furniture,
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands.
Last time I danc'd attendance on his will
Till Paris was besieg'd, famish'd, and lost.
</YORK>
<WARWICK>	<17%>
That can I witness; and a fouler fact
Did never traitor in the land commit.

</YORK>
<K. HENRY>	<17%>
What mean'st thou, Suffolk? tell me, what are these?
</K. HENRY>
<SUFFOLK>	<17%>
Please it your majesty, this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason.
His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
Was rightful heir unto the English crown,
And that your majesty was a usurper.
</SUFFOLK>
<K. HENRY>	<17%>
Say, man, were these thy words?
</K. HENRY>
<HORNER>	<17%>
An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am falsely accused by the villain.
</HORNER>
<PETER>	<17%>
By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my Lord of York's armour.
</PETER>
<YORK>	<17%>
Base dunghill villain, and mechanical,
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
I do beseech your royal majesty
Let him have all the rigour of the law.
</YORK>
<HORNER>	<18%>
Alas! my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words. My accuser is my prentice; and when I did correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me: I have good witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain's accusation.
</HORNER>
<K. HENRY>	<18%>
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
</K. HENRY>
<GLOUCESTER>	<18%>
This doom, my lord, if I may judge.
Let Somerset be regent o'er the French,
Because in York this breeds suspicion;
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place;
For he hath witness of his servant's malice.
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
</GLOUCESTER>
<K. HENRY>	<18%>
Then be it so. My Lord of Somerset,
We make your Grace lord regent o'er the French.
</K. HENRY>
<SOMERSET>	<18%>
I humbly thank your royal majesty.
</SOMERSET>
<HORNER>	<18%>
And I accept the combat willingly.
</HORNER>
<PETER>	<18%>
Alas! my lord, I cannot fight: for God's sake, pity my case! the spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!
</PETER>
<GLOUCESTER>	<18%>
Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.
</GLOUCESTER>

Away with them to prison; and the day
Of combat shall be the last of the next month.
Come, Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.

Ay; what else? fear you not her courage.

Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
The time when screech-owls cry, and ban-dogs howl,

That time best fits the work we have in hand.
Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.

See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.

But him outlive, and die a violent death.
Why, this is just,
Aio te, Æacida, Romanos vincere posse.
Well, to the rest:
Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?

Come, come, my lords; these oracles

But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,

Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.

Why then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?

Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here hath done a miracle; and would ye not think that cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple to his legs again?

O, master, that you could!

A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
Under the countenance and confederacy
Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
The ringleader and head of all this rout,
Have practis'd dangerously against your state,
Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
Whom we have apprehended in the fact;
Raising up wicked spirits from under-ground,
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
And other of your highness' privy council,
As more at large your Grace shall understand.

Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.

Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:

Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest;
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
</Q. MARGARET>
<GLOUCESTER>	<28%>
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,
How I have lov'd my king and commonweal;
And, for my wife, I know not how it stands.
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
Noble she is, but if she have forgot
Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such
As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
I banish her my bed and company,
And give her, as a prey, to law and shame,
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.
</GLOUCESTER>
<K. HENRY>	<28%>
Well, for this night we will repose us here:
To-morrow toward London back again,
To look into this business thoroughly,
And call these foul offenders to their answers;
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.

<SCENE 2>
<London. The Duke of York's Garden.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter York, Salisbury, and Warwick.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YORK>	<28%>
Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
Our simple supper ended, give me leave,
In this close walk to satisfy myself,
In craving your opinion of my title,
Which is infallible to England's crown.
</YORK>
<SALISBURY>	<28%>
My lord, I long to hear it at full.
</SALISBURY>
<WARWICK>	<28%>
Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
</WARWICK>
<YORK>	<29%>
Then thus:
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
Edward the Black Prince died before his father,
And left behind him Richard, his only son,
Who after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king;
Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
And him to Pomfret; where as all you know,
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
</YORK>
<WARWICK>	<29%>
Father, the duke hath told the truth;
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
</WARWICK>
<YORK>	<29%>
Which now they hold by force and not by right;
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
</YORK>
<SALISBURY>	<29%>
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
</SALISBURY>
<YORK>	<29%>
The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe a daughter,
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
Edmund had issue Roger, Earl of March:
Roger had issue Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.
</YORK>
<SALISBURY>	<29%>
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
Who kept him in captivity till he died.
But, to the rest.
</SALISBURY>
<YORK>	<30%>
His eldest sister, Anne,
My mother, being heir unto the crown,
Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
To Roger, Earl of March; who was the son
Of Edmund Mortimer; who married Philippe,
Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence:
So, if the issue of the eldest son
Succeed before the younger, I am king.
</YORK>
<WARWICK>	<30%>
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
And in this private plot be we the first
That shall salute our rightful sovereign
With honour of his birthright to the crown.
</WARWICK>
<BOTH>	<30%>
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
</BOTH>
<YORK>	<30%>
We thank you, lords! But I am not your king
Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
But with advice and silent secrecy.
Do you as I do in these dangerous days,
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
</YORK>
<SALISBURY>	<30%>
My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
</SALISBURY>
<WARWICK>	<31%>
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
</WARWICK>
<YORK>	<31%>
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
The greatest man in England but the king.

In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:

Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death.
You four, from hence to prison back again;
From thence, unto the place of execution:
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
Despoiled of your honour in your life,
Shall, after three days' open penance done,
Live in your country here, in banishment,
With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.

Should be to be protected like a child.

My staff! here, noble Henry, is my staff:
As willingly do I the same resign

Farewell, good king! when I am dead and gone,
May honourable peace attend thy throne.

Ten is the hour that was appointed me
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
The abject people, gazing on thy face
With envious looks still laughing at thy shame,
That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.

<DUCHESS>	<35%>
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
Now thou dost penance too. Look! how they gaze.
See! how the giddy multitude do point,
And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee.
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
</DUCHESS>
<GLOUCESTER>	<35%>
Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
</GLOUCESTER>
<DUCHESS>	<35%>
Ay, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself;
For whilst I think I am thy wedded wife,
And thou a prince, protector of this land,
Methinks I should not thus be led along,
Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,
And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
And when I start, the envious people laugh,
And bid me be advised how I tread.
Ah, Humphrey! can I bear this shameful yoke?
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
No; dark shall be my light, and night my day;
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife;
And he a prince and ruler of the land:
Yet so he rul'd and such a prince he was
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
To every idle rascal follower.
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame;
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
With her that hateth thee, and hates us all,
And York, and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings;
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:
But fear not thou, until thy foot be snar'd,
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
</DUCHESS>
<GLOUCESTER>	<36%>
Ah, Nell! forbear: thou aimest all awry;
I must offend before I be attainted;
And had I twenty times so many foes,
And each of them had twenty times their power,
All these could not procure me any scath,
So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless.
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
Why, yet thy scandal were not wip'd away,
But I in danger for the breach of law.
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:
I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.

'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
</K. HENRY>
<Q. MARGARET>	<38%>
Can you not see? or will ye not observe
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
With what a majesty he bears himself,
How insolent of late he is become,
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
We know the time since he was mild and affable,
An if we did but glance a far-off look,
Immediately he was upon his knee,
That all the court admir'd him for submission:
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
When everyone will give the time of day,
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
But great men tremble when the lion roars;
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
First note that he is near you in descent,
And should you fall, he is the next will mount.
Me seemeth then it is no policy,
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears,
And his advantage following your decease,
That he should come about your royal person
Or be admitted to your highness' council.
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
And when he please to make commotion,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden,
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
Reprove my allegation if you can
Or else conclude my words effectual.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<39%>
Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
And had I first been put to speak my mind,
I think I should have told your Grace's tale.
The duchess, by his subornation,
Upon my life, began her devilish practices:
Or if he were not privy to those faults,
Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
As, next the king he was successive heir,
And such high vaunts of his nobility,
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess,
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
And in his simple show he harbours treason.
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb:
No, no, my sov'reign; Gloucester is a man
Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.
</SUFFOLK>
<CARDINAL>	<40%>
Did he not, contrary to form of law,
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?

Levy great sums of money through the realm
For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?

My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,

Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
From meaning treason to our royal person,
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.
The duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
To dream on evil, or to work my downfall.
</K. HENRY>
<Q. MARGARET>	<40%>
Ah! what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrow'd,
For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf.
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.

Well, Suffolk's duke, thou shalt not see me blush,
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
The purest spring is not so free from mud
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?

And, being protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;

Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,
That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,

Because I would not tax the needy commons,

Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was protector,
Pity was all the fault that was in me;
For I should melt at an offender's tears,
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
Unless it were a bloody murderer,

My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer'd:
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
I do arrest you in his highness' name;
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
To keep until your further time of trial.

My Lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
My conscience tells me you are innocent.
</K. HENRY>
<GLOUCESTER>	<42%>
Ah! gracious lord, these days are dangerous.
Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition,
And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;
Foul subornation is predominant,
And equity exil'd your highness' land.
I know their complot is to have my life;
And if my death might make this island happy,
And prove the period of their tyranny,
I would expend it with all willingness;
But mine is made the prologue to their play;
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
The envious load that lies upon his heart;
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
By false accuse doth level at my life:
And you, my sov'reign lady, with the rest,
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
My liefest liege to be mine enemy.
Ay, all of you have laid your heads together;
Myself had notice of your conventicles;
And all to make away my guiltless life.
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
The ancient proverb will be well effected:
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
</GLOUCESTER>
<CARDINAL>	<43%>
My liege, his railing is intolerable.
If those that care to keep your royal person
From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage

And the offender granted scope of speech,
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
</CARDINAL>

Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
My body round engirt with misery,
For what's more miserable than discontent?
Ah! uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see
The map of honour, truth, and loyalty;
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
That e'er I prov'd thee false, or fear'd thy faith.
What low'ring star now envies thy estate,
That these great lords, and Margaret our queen,
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
And as the butcher takes away the calf,
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
Looking the way her harmless young one went,
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss;
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case,
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
Look after him, and cannot do him good;
So mighty are his vowed enemies.
His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan,
Say 'Who's a traitor, Gloucester he is none.'

Fair lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester's show
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
With sorrow snares relenting passengers;
Or as the snake, roll'd in a flow'ring bank,
With shining checker'd slough, doth sting a child
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I,—
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good,—
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
To rid us from the fear we have of him.

That he should die is worthy policy;
And yet we want a colour for his death.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.

The king will labour still to save his life;

No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock,
Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
As Humphrey, prov'd by reasons, to my liege.
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtilty,
Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
So he be dead; for that is good deceit
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.

<YORK>	<48%>
Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
And change misdoubt to resolution:
Be that thou hop'st to be, or what thou art
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying.
Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man,
And find no harbour in a royal heart.
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought,
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
Well, nobles, well; 'tis politicly done,
To send me packing with a host of men:
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your hearts.
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me:
I take it kindly; yet be well assur'd
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
I will stir up in England some black storm
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
Until the golden circuit on my head,
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
And, for a minister of my intent,
I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman,
John Cade of Ashford,
To make commotion, as full well he can,
Under the title of John Mortimer.
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine:
And, in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
Hath he conversed with the enemy,
And undiscover'd come to me again,
And given me notice of their villanies.
This devil here shall be my substitute;
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble;
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
How they affect the house and claim of York.
Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured,
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms.
Say that he thrive,—as 'tis great like he will,—
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength,
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
For, Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
And Henry put apart, the next for me.

Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words:
Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say:
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.
Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:
Yet do not go away; come, basilisk,
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
For in the shade of death I shall find joy,
In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.

<Q. MARGARET>	<51%>
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
Although the duke was enemy to him,
Yet he, most Christian-like, laments his death:
And for myself, foe as he was to me,
Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
And all to have the noble duke alive.
What know I how the world may deem of me?
For it is known we were but hollow friends:
It may be judg'd I made the duke away:
So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy!
To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!
</Q. MARGARET>
<K. HENRY>	<52%>
Ah! woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man.
</K. HENRY>
<Q. MARGARET>	<52%>
Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
What! dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
Why, then, Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy:
Erect his statua and worship it,
And make my image but an alehouse sign.
Was I for this nigh wrack'd upon the sea,
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
Drove back again unto my native clime?
What boded this, but well forewarning wind
Did seem to say, 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore?'
What did I then, but curs'd the gentle gusts
And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
Yet Æolus would not be a murderer,
But left that hateful office unto thee:
The pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness:
The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands,
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
And when the dusky sky began to rob
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
I took a costly jewel from my neck,
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
And threw it towards thy land: the sea receiv'd it,
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
And even with this I lost fair England's view,
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue—
The agent of thy foul inconstancy—
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
When he to madding Dido would unfold
His father's acts, commenc'd in burning Troy!
Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
Ay me! I can no more. Die, Margaret!
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,
Being all descended to the labouring heart;
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;
Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth
To blush and beautify the cheek again.
But see, his face is black and full of blood,
His eyeballs further out than when he liv'd,
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretch'd with struggling:
His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd
And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.
Look on the sheets, his hair, you see, is sticking;
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodg'd.
It cannot be but he was murder'd here;
The least of all these signs were probable.

Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:
Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee,

Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn
Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?

The traitorous Warwick, with the men of Bury,
Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.

</STAGE DIR>
<SALISBURY>	<57%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Speaking to those within.>
</STAGE DIR> Sirs, stand apart; the king shall know your mind.
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,
Unless false Suffolk straight be done to death,
Or banished fair England's territories,
They will by violence tear him from your palace
And torture him with grievous lingering death.
They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
They say, in him they fear your highness' death;
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
As being thought to contradict your liking,
Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
They say, in care of your most royal person,
That if your highness should intend to sleep,
And charge that no man should disturb your rest
In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
That slily glided towards your majesty,
It were but necessary you were wak'd,
Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal:
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
That they will guard you, whe'r you will or no,
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is;
With whose envenomed and fatal sting,
Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
They say, is shamefully bereft of life.

'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,
Could send such message to their sovereign;
But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,
To show how quaint an orator you are:
But all the honour Salisbury hath won
Is that he was the lord ambassador,
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.

</STAGE DIR> An answer from the king, or we will all break in!
</COMMONERS>
<K. HENRY>	<58%>
Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me,
I thank them for their tender loving care;
And had I not been cited so by them,
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy
Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
And therefore, by his majesty I swear,
Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
He shall not breathe infection in this air
But three days longer, on the pain of death.
</K. HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Salisbury.>
</STAGE DIR>
<Q. MARGARET>	<58%>
O Henry! let me plead for gentle Suffolk.
</Q. MARGARET>
<K. HENRY>	<58%>
Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR> If after three days' space thou here be'st found
On any ground that I am ruler of,
The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
I have great matters to impart to thee.
</K. HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt King Henry, Warwick, Lords, &c.>
</STAGE DIR>
<Q. MARGARET>	<59%>
Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
Heart's discontent and sour affliction
Be playfellows to keep you company!
There's two of you; the devil make a third,
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<59%>
Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<59%>
Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<59%>
A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them?
Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
With full as many signs of deadly hate,
As lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave.
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
My hair be fix'd on end, as one distract;
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
And even now my burden'd heart would break
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
Their softest touch as smart as lizard's stings!
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell—
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<60%>
Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
Or like an over-charged gun, recoil,
And turn the force of them upon thyself.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<60%>
You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
Well could I curse away a winter's night,
Though standing naked on a mountain top,
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
And think it but a minute spent in sport.
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<60%>
O! let me entreat thee, cease! Give me thy hand,
That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
To wash away my woeful monuments.
O! could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses his hand.>
</STAGE DIR>
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee.
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
I will repeal thee, or, be well assur'd,
Adventure to be banished myself;
And banished I am, if but from thee.
Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
O! go not yet. Even thus two friends condemn'd
Embrace and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,
Loather a hundred times to part than die.
Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<60%>
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,
Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
A wilderness is populous enough,
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
For where thou art, there is the world itself,
With every several pleasure in the world,
And where thou art not, desolation.
I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;
Myself to joy in nought but that thou liv'st.
</SUFFOLK>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Vaux.>
</STAGE DIR>
<Q. MARGARET>	<61%>
Whither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?
</Q. MARGARET>
<VAUX>	<61%>
To signify unto his majesty
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,
That makes him gasp and stare, and catch the air,
Blaspheming God, and cursing men on earth.
Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
The secrets of his overcharged soul:
And I am sent to tell his majesty
That even now he cries aloud for him.
</VAUX>
<Q. MARGARET>	<61%>
Go tell this heavy message to the king.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Vaux.>
</STAGE DIR>
Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,
Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?
Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?
Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;
If thou be found by me thou art but dead.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<61%>
If I depart from thee I cannot live;
And in thy sight to die, what were it else
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
As mild and gentle as the cradle babe,
Dying with mother's dug between its lips;
Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth:
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium.
To die by thee, were but to die in jest;
From thee to die were torture more than death.
O! let me stay, befall what may befall!
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<62%>
Away! though parting be a fretful corsive,
It is applied to a deathful wound.
To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;
For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<62%>
I go.
</SUFFOLK>
<Q. MARGARET>	<62%>
And take my heart with thee.
</Q. MARGARET>
<SUFFOLK>	<62%>
A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask
That ever did contain a thing of worth.
Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we:
This way fall I to death.

How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.
</K. HENRY>
<CARDINAL>	<62%>
If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,
Enough to purchase such another island,
So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.
</CARDINAL>
<K. HENRY>	<62%>
Ah! what a sign it is of evil life
Where death's approach is seen so terrible.
</K. HENRY>
<WARWICK>	<62%>
Beaufort, it is thy sov'reign speaks to thee.
</WARWICK>
<CARDINAL>	<63%>
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
Can I make men live whe'r they will or no?
O! torture me no more, I will confess.
Alive again? then show me where he is:
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
Comb down his hair; look! look! it stands upright,
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
</CARDINAL>
<K. HENRY>	<63%>
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens!
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch;
O! beat away the busy meddling fiend
That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul,
And from his bosom purge this black despair.
</K. HENRY>
<WARWICK>	<63%>
See how the pangs of death do make him grin!
</WARWICK>
<SALISBURY>	<63%>
Disturb him not! let him pass peaceably.

<K. HENRY>	<63%>
Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
Lord Cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!

<Kent. The Seashore near Dover.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Firing heard at Sea. Then enter from a boat, a Captain,...>
<... a Master, a Master's-Mate, Walter Whitmore, and...>
<... Others; with them Suffolk disguised, and other Gentlemen, prisoners.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CAPTAIN>	<63%>
The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day
Is crept into the bosom of the sea,
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
That drag the tragic melancholy night;
Who with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings
Clip dead men's graves, and from their misty jaws
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,
For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.
Master, this prisoner freely give I thee:
And thou that art his mate make boot of this;
The other <STAGE DIR>
<Pointing to Suffolk>
</STAGE DIR>, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.
</CAPTAIN>
<GENTLEMAN 1>	<64%>
What is my ransom, master? let me know.
</GENTLEMAN 1>
<MASTER>	<64%>
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
</MASTER>
<MATE>	<64%>
And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
</MATE>
<CAPTAIN>	<64%>
What! think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
Cut both the villains' throats! for die you shall:
The lives of those which we have lost in fight
Cannot be counterpois'd with such a petty sum!
</CAPTAIN>
<GENTLEMAN 1>	<64%>
I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.
</GENTLEMAN 1>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<64%>
And so will I, and write home for it straight.
</GENTLEMAN 2>
<WHITMORE>	<64%>
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
<STAGE DIR>
<To Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR> And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die;
And so should these if I might have my will.
</WHITMORE>
<CAPTAIN>	<64%>
Be not so rash: take ransom; let him live.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<64%>
Look on my George; I am a gentleman:
Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
</SUFFOLK>
<WHITMORE>	<64%>
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
How now! why start'st thou? what! doth death affright?
</WHITMORE>
<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
A cunning man did calculate my birth,
And told me that by Water I should die:
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
Thy name is—Gaultier, being rightly sounded.
</SUFFOLK>
<WHITMORE>	<65%>
Gaultier, or Walter, which it is I care not;
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
But with our sword we wip'd away the blot:
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac'd,
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
</WHITMORE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Lays hold on Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
</SUFFOLK>
<WHITMORE>	<65%>
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
</WHITMORE>
<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:
Jove sometimes went disguis'd, and why not I?
</SUFFOLK>
<CAPTAIN>	<65%>
But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
The honourable blood of Lancaster,
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule,
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
How often hast thou waited at my cup,
Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board,
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n;
Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride.
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
And duly waited for my coming forth?
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
</SUFFOLK>
<WHITMORE>	<66%>
Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
</WHITMORE>
<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<66%>
Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
</SUFFOLK>
<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
Convey him hence, and on our longboat's side
Strike off his head.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<66%>
Thou dar'st not for thy own.
</SUFFOLK>
<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
Yes, Pole.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<66%>
Pole!
</SUFFOLK>
<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
Thy lips, that kiss'd the queen, shall sweep the ground;
And thou, that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death,
Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain,
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
For daring to affy a mighty lord
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
By devilish policy art thou grown great,
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorg'd
With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
The false revolting Normans thorough thee
Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
Hath slain their governors, surpris'd our forts,
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
By shameful murder of a guiltless king,
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours
Advance our half-fac'd sun, striving to shine,
Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus.
The commons here in Kent are up in arms;
And to conclude, reproach and beggary
Is crept into the palace of our king,
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
O! that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges.
Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
Drones suck not eagles' blood, but rob beehives.
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
Thy words move rage, and not remorse in me:
I go of message from the queen to France;
I charge thee, waft me safely cross the Channel.
</SUFFOLK>
<CAPTAIN>	<67%>
Walter!
</CAPTAIN>
<WHITMORE>	<67%>
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
</WHITMORE>
<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
Gelidus timor occupat artus: 'tis thee I fear.
</SUFFOLK>
<WHITMORE>	<67%>
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
What! are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
</WHITMORE>
<GENTLEMAN 1>	<67%>
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
</GENTLEMAN 1>
<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
Us'd to command, untaught to plead for favour.
Far be it we should honour such as these
With humble suit: no, rather let my head
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
Save to the God of heaven, and to my king;
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
True nobility is exempt from fear:
More can I bear than you dare execute.
</SUFFOLK>
<CAPTAIN>	<67%>
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
</CAPTAIN>
<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
That this my death may never be forgot.
Great men oft die by vile bezonians.
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
Stabb'd Julius Cæsar; savage islanders
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.

<STAGE DIR>
<Exit with Suffolk, Whitmore and Others.>

I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.

So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.

O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.

The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
</JOHN>
<GEORGE>	<69%>
Nay, more; the king's council are no good workmen.

True; and yet it is said, 'Labour in thy vocation:' which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be labouring men; and therefore should we be magistrates.

Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand.

He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's-leather of.

Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's throat cut like a calf.

I thank you, good people: there shall be no money; all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like brothers, and worship me their lord.

<DICK>	<70%>
The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
</DICK>
<CADE>	<70%>
Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings; but I say, 'tis the bee's wax, for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since. How now! who's there?

Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.

Nay, then he is a conjurer.

Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.

I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die. Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee. What is thy name?

Emmanuel.

But angry, wrathful, and inclin'd to blood,
If you go forward: therefore yield, or die.

<CADE>	<72%>
As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:
It is to you, good people, that I speak,
O'er whom, in time to come I hope to reign;
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
</CADE>
<STAFFORD>	<72%>
Villain! thy father was a plasterer;
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
</STAFFORD>
<CADE>	<72%>
And Adam was a gardener.

<STAFFORD>	<72%>
And what of that?
</STAFFORD>
<CADE>	<72%>
Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March,
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?
</CADE>
<STAFFORD>	<72%>
Ay, sir.
</STAFFORD>
<CADE>	<72%>
By her he had two children at one birth.
</CADE>
<STAFFORD>	<72%>
That's false.
</STAFFORD>
<CADE>	<72%>
Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:
The elder of them, being put to nurse,
Was by a beggar-woman stol'n away;
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
Became a bricklayer when he came to age:
His son am I; deny it if you can.
</CADE>
<DICK>	<73%>
Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.
</DICK>
<SMITH>	<73%>
Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it; therefore deny it not.
</SMITH>
<STAFFORD>	<73%>
And will you credit this base drudge's words,
That speaks he knows not what?
</STAFFORD>
<ALL>	<73%>
Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.

Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.

<CADE>	<73%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> He lies, for I invented it myself. Go to, sirrah; tell the king from me, that, for his father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.
</CADE>
<DICK>	<73%>
And furthermore, we'll have the Lord Say's head for selling the dukedom of Maine.
</DICK>
<CADE>	<73%>
And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it a eunuch; and more than that, he can speak French; and therefore he is a traitor.
</CADE>
<STAFFORD>	<73%>
O gross and miserable ignorance!
</STAFFORD>
<CADE>	<73%>
Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our enemies; go to then, I ask but this, can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor, or no?
</CADE>
<ALL>	<73%>
No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
</ALL>
<STAFFORD>	<73%>
Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
Assail them with the army of the king.
</STAFFORD>
<STAFFORD>	<73%>
Herald, away; and throughout every town
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
That those which fly before the battle ends
May, even in their wives' and children's sight,
Be hang'd up for example at their doors:
And you, that be the king's friends, follow me.

And you, that love the commons, follow me.
Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.
We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,
For they are thrifty honest men, and such
As would, but that they dare not take our parts.
</CADE>

<Q. MARGARET>	<75%>
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
And makes it fearful and degenerate;
Think therefore on revenge, and cease to weep.
But who can cease to weep and look on this?
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast;
But where's the body that I should embrace?
</Q. MARGARET>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<75%>
What answer makes your Grace to the rebels' supplication?
</BUCKINGHAM>
<K. HENRY>	<75%>
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;
For God forbid so many simple souls
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
Will parley with Jack Cade their general.
But stay, I'll read it over once again.

Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face
Rul'd like a wandering planet over me,

Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.

<SAY>	<75%>
Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.

How now, madam!
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
Thou wouldest not have mourn'd so much for me.

No, my love; I should not mourn, but die for thee.

<MESSENGER>	<76%>
The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,
And calls your Grace usurper openly,
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
His army is a ragged multitude
Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:
Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.
All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.
</MESSENGER>
<K. HENRY>	<76%>
O graceless men! they know not what they do.
</K. HENRY>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<76%>
My gracious lord, retire to Killingworth,
Until a power be rais'd to put them down.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<Q. MARGARET>	<76%>
Ah! were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeas'd.
</Q. MARGARET>
<K. HENRY>	<76%>
Lord Say, the traitors hate thee,
Therefore away with us to Killingworth.
</K. HENRY>
<SAY>	<76%>
So might your Grace's person be in danger.
The sight of me is odious in their eyes;
And therefore in this city will I stay,
And live alone as secret as I may.

Then linger not, my lord; away! take horse.

<SCALES>	<77%>
Such aid as I can spare you shall command;
But I am troubled here with them myself;
The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.
But get you to Smithfield and gather head,

Fight for your king, your country, and your lives;
And so, farewell, for I must hence again.

Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah! thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord; now art thou within pointblank of our jurisdiction regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Monsieur Basimecu, the Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar-school; and whereas, before, our fore-fathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be used; and, contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian car can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live. Thou dost ride on a foot-cloth, dost thou not?

Kent, in the Commentaries Cæsar writ,
Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle:
Sweet is the country, because full of riches;
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy;
Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.
Justice with favour have I always done;
Prayers and tears have mov'd me, gifts could never.
When have I aught exacted at your hands,
But to maintain the king, the realm, and you?
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,
Because my book preferr'd me to the king,
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,
You cannot but forbear to murder me:
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
For your behoof,—
</SAY>

Tell me wherein have I offended most?
Have I affected wealth, or honour? speak.

Alas! he hath no home, no place to fly to;
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,
The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?
Methinks already in this civil broil
I see them lording it in London streets,
Crying Villiago! unto all they meet.
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry,
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.
To France, to France! and get what you have lost;
Spare England, for it is your native coast.

Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,
And could command no more content than I?
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle
But I was made a king at nine months old:
Was never subject long'd to be a king
As I do long and wish to be a subject.

<K. HENRY>	<85%>
Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
Soldiers, this day have you redeem'd your lives,
And show'd how well you love your prince and country:
Continue still in this so good a mind,
And Henry, though he be infortunate,
Assure yourselves, will never be unkind:
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,
I do dismiss you to your several countries.

</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER>	<85%>
Please it your Grace to be advertised,
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland;
And with a puissant and a mighty power
Of Gallowglasses, and stout kerns,
Is marching hitherward in proud array;
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
His arms are only to remove from thee
The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.
</MESSENGER>
<K. HENRY>	<85%>
Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd;
Like to a ship, that, having scap'd a tempest,
Is straight way calm'd, and boarded with a pirate.
But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers'd;
And now is York in arms to second him.
I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;
And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither,
Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
</K. HENRY>
<SOMERSET>	<86%>
My lord,
I'll yield myself to prison willingly,
Or unto death, to do my country good.
</SOMERSET>
<K. HENRY>	<86%>
In any case, be not too rough in terms;
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.
</K. HENRY>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<86%>
I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal
As all things shall redound unto your good.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<K. HENRY>	<86%>
Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;
For yet may England curse my wretched reign.

<Kent. Iden's Garden.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cade.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CADE>	<86%>
Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword, and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now I am so hungry, that if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet' was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet' must serve me to feed on.
</CADE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Iden with Servants behind.>
</STAGE DIR>
<IDEN>	<87%>
Lord! who would live turmoiled in the court,
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
This small inheritance my father left me
Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.
I seek not to wax great by others' waning,
Or gather wealth I care not with what envy:
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state,
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
</IDEN>
<CADE>	<87%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave. Ah, villain! thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.
</CADE>
<IDEN>	<87%>
Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
I know thee not; why then should I betray thee?
Is't not enough to break into my garden,
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?
</IDEN>
<CADE>	<87%>
Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a door-nail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.
</CADE>
<IDEN>	<87%>
Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,
Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,
See if thou canst out-face me with thy looks:
Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist;
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
And if mine arm be heaved in the air
Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
As for more words, whose greatness answers words,
Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
</IDEN>
<CADE>	<88%>
By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech Jove on my knees, thou mayst be turned to hobnails. <STAGE DIR>
<They fight; Cade falls.>
</STAGE DIR> O, I am slain! Famine and no other hath slain me: let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house, because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
</CADE>
<IDEN>	<88%>
Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,
And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:
Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,
But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,
To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
</IDEN>
<CADE>	<88%>
Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.
</CADE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
<IDEN>	<88%>
How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee!
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell.
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
And there cut off thy most ungracious head;
Which I will bear in triumph to the king,
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

<The King's camp on one side. On the other, enter York,...>
<... and his army of Irish, with drum and colours.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YORK>	<89%>
From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
To entertain great England's lawful king.
Ah sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?
Let them obey that know not how to rule;
This hand was made to handle nought but gold:
I cannot give due action to my words,
Except a sword, or sceptre balance it.
A sceptre shall it have, have I-a soul,
On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Buckingham.>
</STAGE DIR>
Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
</YORK>
The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
<BUCKINGHAM>	<89%>
York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<YORK>	<89%>
Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?
</YORK>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<89%>
A messenger from Henry, our dread hege,
To know the reason of these arms in peace;
Or why thou,—being a subject as I am,—
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
Shouldst raise so great a power without his leave,
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<YORK>	<90%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:
O! I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
I am so angry at these abject terms;
And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
I am far better born than is the king,
More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts;
But I must make fair weather yet awhile,
Till Henry be more weak, and I more strong.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aloud.>
</STAGE DIR> Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
That I have given no answer all this while;
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
The cause why I have brought this army hither
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
Seditious to his Grace and to the state.
</YORK>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<90%>
That is too much presumption on thy part:
But if thy arms be to no other end,
The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<YORK>	<90%>
Upon thine honour, is he a prisoner?
</YORK>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<90%>
Upon mine honour, he is a prisoner.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<YORK>	<90%>
Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
Meet me to-morrow in Saint George's field,
You shall have pay, and everything you wish,
And let my sov'reign, virtuous Henry,
Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
As pledges of my fealty and love;
I'll send them all as willing as I live:
Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have
Is his to use, so Somerset may die.
</YORK>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<91%>
York, I commend this kind submission:
We twain will go into his highness' tent.

<Enter King Henry, attended.>

<K. HENRY>	<91%>
Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
</K. HENRY>
<YORK>	<91%>
In all submission and humility
York doth present himself unto your highness.
</YORK>
<K. HENRY>	<91%>
Then what intend these forces thou dost bring?
</K. HENRY>
<YORK>	<91%>
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
And fight against that monstrous rebel, Cade,
Who since I heard to be discomfited.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Iden, with Cade's head.>
</STAGE DIR>
<IDEN>	<91%>
If one so rude and of so mean condition
May pass into the presence of a king,
Lo! I present your Grace a traitor's head,
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.
</IDEN>
<K. HENRY>	<91%>
The head of Cade! Great God, how just art thou!
O! let me view his visage, being dead,
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?
</K. HENRY>
<IDEN>	<91%>
I was, an't like your majesty.
</IDEN>
<K. HENRY>	<91%>
How art thou call'd, and what is thy degree?
</K. HENRY>
<IDEN>	<91%>
Alexander Iden, that's my name;
A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.
</IDEN>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<91%>
So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
He were created knight for his good service.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<K. HENRY>	<91%>

<He kneels.>
</STAGE DIR> Rise up a knight.
We give thee for reward a thousand marks;
And will, that thou henceforth attend on us.

May Iden live to merit such a bounty,
And never live but true unto his liege!
</IDEN>
<K. HENRY>	<91%>
See! Buckingham! Somerset comes with the queen:
Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.
</K. HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Queen Margaret and Somerset.>

<Q. MARGARET>	<92%>
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
But boldly stand and front him to his face.
</Q. MARGARET>
<YORK>	<92%>
How now! is Somerset at liberty?
Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
King did I call thee? no, thou art not king;
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
Which dar'st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
That head of thine doth not become a crown;
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
Is able with the change to kill and cure.
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,
And with the same to act controlling laws.
Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more
O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
</YORK>
<SOMERSET>	<92%>
O monstrous traitor:—I arrest thee, York,
Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown.
Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.

If they can brook I bow a knee to man.

O blood-bespotted Neapolitan,

Nay, do not fright us with an angry look:
We are thy sov'reign, Clifford, kneel again;
For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.

<CLIFFORD>	<93%>
This is my king, York, I do not mistake;
But thou mistak'st me much to think I do.
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
</CLIFFORD>
<K. HENRY>	<93%>
Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
Makes him oppose himself against his king.
</K. HENRY>
<CLIFFORD>	<93%>
He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,
And chop away that factious pate of his.
</CLIFFORD>
<Q. MARGARET>	<93%>
He is arrested, but will not obey:
His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.
</Q. MARGARET>
<YORK>	<93%>
Will you not, sons?

<EDWARD>	<93%>
Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.

Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
That with the very shaking of their chains
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
</YORK>
<STAGE DIR>
<Drums. Enter Warwick and Salisbury, with Forces.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLIFFORD>	<94%>
Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death,
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,
If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place.
</CLIFFORD>
<RICHARD>	<94%>
Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,
Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs, and cried:
And such a piece of service will you do,
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
</RICHARD>
<CLIFFORD>	<94%>
Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
</CLIFFORD>

Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
</YORK>
<CLIFFORD>	<94%>
Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
</CLIFFORD>
<K. HENRY>	<94%>
Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
What! wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
O! where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
If it be banish'd from the frosty head,
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
And shame thine honourable age with blood?
Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me,
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
</K. HENRY>
<SALISBURY>	<95%>
My lord, I have consider'd with myself
The title of this most renowned duke;
And in my conscience do repute his Grace
The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
</SALISBURY>
<K. HENRY>	<95%>
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
</K. HENRY>
<SALISBURY>	<95%>
I have.
</SALISBURY>
<K. HENRY>	<95%>
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
</K. HENRY>
<SALISBURY>	<95%>
It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
Who can be bound by any solemn vow
To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,
To force a spotless virgin's chastity,
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,
To wring the widow from her custom'd right,
And have no other reason for this wrong
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
</SALISBURY>
<Q. MARGARET>	<95%>
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.

<K. HENRY>	<95%>
Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.

You were best to go to bed and dream again,
To keep thee from the tempest of the field.

<CLIFFORD>	<95%>
I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,
Might I but know thee by thy household badge.
</CLIFFORD>
<WARWICK>	<95%>
Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,
This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,—
As on a mountain-top the cedar shows,
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,—
Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
</WARWICK>
<CLIFFORD>	<95%>
And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear,
And tread it underfoot with all contempt,
Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.

And so to arms, victorious father,
To quell the rebels and their complices.

Whom angry heavens do make their minister,
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly:

Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself
Hath not essentially, but by circumstance,
The name of valour.

O! let the vile world end,
And the premised flames of the last day
Knit heaven and earth together;
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
Particularities and petty sounds
To cease!—Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,
To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve
The silver livery of advised age,
And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares:
No more will I their babes: tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;
And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
Meet I an infant of the house of York,
Into as many gobbets will I cut it
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:

I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly;
But fly you must: uncurable discomfit
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
Away, for your relief! and we will live
To see their day and them our fortune give.
Away, my lord, away!

<Alarum. Retreat. Flourish; then enter York, Richard, Warwick, and Soldiers, with drum and colours.>

<YORK>	<99%>
Of Salisbury, who can report of him;
That winter lion, who in rage forgets
Aged contusions and all brush of time,
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
Repairs him with occasion? this happy day
Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
If Salisbury be lost.
</YORK>
<RICHARD>	<99%>
My noble father,
Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,
Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,
Persuaded him from any further act:
But still, where danger was, still there I met him;
And like rich hangings in a homely house,
So was his will in his old feeble body.
But, noble as he is, look where he comes.
</RICHARD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Salisbury.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SALISBURY>	<99%>
Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;
By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:
God knows how long it is I have to live;
And it hath pleas'd him that three times to-day
You have defended me from imminent death.
Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
Being opposites of such repairing nature.
</SALISBURY>
<YORK>	<100%>
I know our safety is to follow them;
For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,
To call a present court of parliament:
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth:—
What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
</YORK>
<WARWICK>	<100%>
After them! nay, before them, if we can.
Now, by my hand, lords, 'twas a glorious day:
Saint Alban's battle, won by famous York,
Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come.
Sound, drums and trumpets, and to London all:
And more such days as these to us befall!
</WARWICK>
