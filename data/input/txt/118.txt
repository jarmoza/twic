For every Bird a nest -
Wherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking round -
Wherefore when boughs are free,
Households in every tree,
Pilgrim be found?
Perhaps a home too high -
Ah aristocracy!
The little Wren desires -
Perhaps of twig so fine -
Of twine e'en superfine,
Her pride aspires -
The Lark is not ashamed
To build opon the ground
Her modest house -
Yet who of all the throng
Dancing around the sun
Does so rejoice?
