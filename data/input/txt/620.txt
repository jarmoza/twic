I Years had been from Home
And now before the Door
I dared not enter, lest a Face
I never saw before
Stare stolid into mine
And ask my Business there -
"My Business but a Life I left
Was such remaining there?"
I leaned opon the Awe -
I lingered with Before -
The Second like an Ocean rolled
And broke against my ear -
I laughed a crumbling Laugh
That I could fear a Door
Who Consternation compassed
And never winced before.
I fitted to the Latch
My Hand, with trembling care
Lest back the awful Door should spring
And leave me in the Floor -
Then moved my Fingers off
As cautiously as Glass
And held my ears, and like a Thief
Fled gasping from the House -
