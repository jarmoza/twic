The Future -- never spoke --
Nor will He -- like the Dumb --
Reveal by sign -- a syllable
Of His Profound To Come --
But when the News be ripe --
Presents it -- in the Act --
Forestalling Preparation --
Escape -- or Substitute --
Indifferent to Him --
The Dower -- as the Doom --
His Office -- but to execute Fate's --
Telegram -- to Him --
