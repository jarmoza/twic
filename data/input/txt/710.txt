Of Brussels - it was not -
Of Kidderminster? Nay -
The Winds did buy it of the Woods -
They - sold it unto me
It was a gentle price -
The poorest - could afford -
It was within the frugal purse
Of Beggar - or of Bird -
Of small and spicy Yards -
In hue - a mellow Dun -
Of Sunshine - and of Sere - Composed -
But, principally - of Sun -
The Wind - unrolled it fast -
And spread it on the Ground -
Upholsterer of the Pines - is He -
Upholsterer - of the Pond -
