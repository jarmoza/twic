Our journey had advanced -
Our feet were almost come
To that odd Fork in Being's Road -
Eternity - by Term -
Our pace took sudden awe -
Our feet - reluctant - led -
Before - were Cities - but Between -
The Forest of the Dead -
Retreat - was out of Hope -
Behind - a Sealed Route -
Eternity's White Flag - Before -
And God - at every Gate -
