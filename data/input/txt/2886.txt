It dont sound so terrible -- quite -- as it did --
I run it over -- "Dead", Brain, "Dead."
Put it in Latin -- left of my school --
Seems it dont shriek so -- under rule.
Turn it, a little -- full in the face
A Trouble looks bitterest --
Shift it -- just --
Say "When Tomorrow comes this way --
I shall have waded down one Day".
I suppose it will interrupt me some
Till I get accustomed -- but then the Tomb
Like other new Things -- shows largest -- then --
And smaller, by Habit --
It's shrewder then
Put the Thought in advance -- a Year --
How like "a fit" -- then --
Murder -- wear!
