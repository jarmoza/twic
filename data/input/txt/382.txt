Ah, Moon, and Star!
You are very far -
But were no one
Farther than you -
Do you think I'd stop
For a Firmament -
Or a Cubit - or so?
I could borrow a Bonnet
Of the Lark -
And a Chamois' silver Boot -
And a stirrup of an Antelope -
And be with you - tonight!
But, Moon, and Star,
Though you're very far -
There is one - farther than you -
He - is more than a - from me -
So I can never go!
