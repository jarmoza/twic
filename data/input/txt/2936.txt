I meant to have but modest needs --
Such as Content -- and Heaven --
Within my income -- these could lie
And Life and I -- keep even --
But since the last -- included both --
It would suffice my Prayer
But just for One -- to stipulate --
And Grace would grant the Pair --
And so -- upon this wise -- I prayed --
Great Spirit -- Give to me
A Heaven not so large as Your's,
But large enough -- for me --
A Smile suffused Jehovah's face --
The Cherubim -- withdrew --
Grave Saints stole out to look at me --
And showed their dimples -- too --
I left the Place, with all my might --
I threw my Prayer away --
The Quiet Ages picked it up --
And Judgment -- twinkled -- too --
That one so honest -- be extant --
It take the Tale for true --
That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask --
Itself be given You" --
But I, grown shrewder -- scan the Skies
With a suspicious Air --
As Children -- swindled for the first
All Swindlers -- be -- infer -- --
