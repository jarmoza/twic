What I see not, I better see --
Through Faith -- my Hazel Eye
Has periods of shutting --
But, No lid has Memory --
For frequent, all my sense obscured
I equally behold
As someone held a light unto
The Features so beloved --
And I arise -- and in my Dream --
Do Thee distinguished Grace --
Till jealous Daylight interrupt --
And mar thy perfectness --
