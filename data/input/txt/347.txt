Some keep the Sabbath going to church,
I keep it staying at home,
With a bobolink for a chorister,
And an orchard for a dome.
Some keep the Sabbath in surplice,
I just wear my wings,
And instead of tolling the bell for church,
Our little sexton sings.
God preachesa noted clergyman,
And the sermon is never long;
So instead of going to heaven at last,
I'm going all along
