Bloom opon the Mountain stated -
Blameless of a name -
Efflorescence of a Sunset -
Reproduced - the same -
Seed had I, my Purple Sowing
Should address the Day -
Not - a Tropic of a Twilight -
Show itself away -
Who for tilling - to the Mountain
Come - and disappear -
Whose be her Renown - or fading -
Witness is not here -
While I state - the Solemn Petals -
Far as North - and East -
Far as South - and West  expanding -
Culminate - in Rest -
And the Mountain to the Evening
Fit His Countenance -
Indicating by no Muscle
His Experience -
