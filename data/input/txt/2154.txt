The Things that never can come back, are several -
Childhood - some forms of Hope - the Dead -
Though Joys - like Men - may sometimes make a Journey -
And still abide -
We do not mourn for Traveler, or Sailor,
Their Routes are fair -
But think enlarged of all that they will tell us
Returning here -
"Here"! There are typic "Heres" -
Foretold Locations -
The Spirit does not stand -
Himself - at whatsoever Fathom
His Native Land -
