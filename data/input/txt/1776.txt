The Symptom of the Gale -
The Second of Dismay -
Between it's Rumor and it's Face -
Is almost Revelry -
The Houses firmer root -
The Heavens cannot be found -
The Upper Surfaces of things
Take covert in the Ground -
The Mem'ry of the Sun
Not Any can recall -
Although by Nature's sterling Watch
So scant an interval -
And when the Noise is caught
And Nature looks around -
"We dreamed it"? she interrogates -
"Good Morning" - we propound?
