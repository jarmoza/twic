Except the smaller size -
No Lives - are Round -
These hurry to a Sphere -
And show and end -
The Larger - slower grow -
And later - hang -
The Summers of Hesperides
Are long -
Hugest of Core
Present the awkward Rind -
Yield Groups of Ones -
No Cluster - ye shall find -
But far after Frost -
And Indian Summer Noon -
Ships - offer These -
As West - Indian -
