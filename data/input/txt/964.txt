Each Life converges to some Centre -
Expressed - or still -
Exists in every Human Nature
A Goal -
Embodied scarcely to itself - it may be -
Too fair
For Credibility's presumption
To mar -
Adored with caution - as a Brittle Heaven -
To reach
Were hopeless, as the Rainbow's Raiment
To touch -
Yet persevered toward - surer - for the Distance -
How high -
Unto the Saints' slow  diligence -
The Sky -
Ungained - it may be - by a Life's low Venture -
But then -
Eternity enable the
Again.
