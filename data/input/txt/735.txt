I reckon - When I count at all -
First - Poets - Then the Sun -
Then Summer - Then the Heaven of God -
And then - the List is done -
But, looking back - the First so seems
To Comprehend the Whole -
The Others look a needless Show -
So I write - Poets - All -
Their Summer - lasts a solid Year -
They can afford a Sun
The East - would deem extravagant -
And if the Further Heaven -
Be Beautiful as they prepare
For Those who worship Them -
It is too difficult a Grace -
To justify the Dream -
