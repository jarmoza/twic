<ACT 1>
<SCENE 1>
<A Room of State in King Lear's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR>
<KENT>	<0%>
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>	<0%>
It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>	<0%>
Is not this your son, my lord?
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it.
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>	<1%>
I cannot conceive you.
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>	<1%>
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came somewhat saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<1%>
No, my lord.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<1%>
My services to your lordship.
</EDMUND>
<KENT>	<1%>
I must love you, and sue to know you better.
</KENT>
<EDMUND>	<1%>
Sir, I shall study deserving.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The king is coming.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Sennet. Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEAR>	<1%>
Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
</LEAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
I shall, my liege.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEAR>	<1%>
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age,
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
Unburden'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,—
Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state,—
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest-born, speak first.
</LEAR>
<GONERIL>	<2%>
Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
Beyond what can be valu'd, rich or rare;
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
</GONERIL>
<CORDELIA>	<2%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<2%>
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
</LEAR>
<REGAN>	<2%>
I am made of that self metal as my sister,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short: that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness' love.
</REGAN>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Then, poor Cordelia!
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
More richer than my tongue.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
To thee and thine, hereditary ever,
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
Although our last, not least; to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
Nothing, my lord.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
Nothing?
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
Nothing.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
According to my bond; nor more nor less.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
Lest you may mar your fortunes.
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I
Return those duties back as are right fit,
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
But goes thy heart with this?
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
Ay, good my lord.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
So young, and so untender?
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>	<3%>
So young, my lord, and true.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<3%>
Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be,
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
As thou my sometime daughter.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<4%>
Good my liege,—
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<4%>
Peace, Kent!
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
So be my grave my peace, as here I give
Her father's heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
With my two daughters' dowers digest the third;
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly with my power,
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,
With reservation of a hundred knights,
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain
The name and all th' addition to a king;
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
This coronet part between you.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<4%>
Royal Lear,
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,—
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<4%>
The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<4%>
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state;
And, in thy best consideration, check
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<5%>
Kent, on thy life, no more.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<5%>
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
Thy safety being the motive.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<5%>
Out of my sight!
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<5%>
See better, Lear; and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<5%>
Now, by Apollo,—
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<5%>
Now, by Apollo, king,
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<5%>
O vassal! miscreant!
</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Laying his hand on his sword.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALBANY>	<5%>
Dear sir, forbear.
</ALBANY>
<CORNWALL>	<5%>
Dear sir, forbear.
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<5%>
Do;
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift;
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<5%>
Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance, hear me!
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,—
Which we durst never yet,—and, with strain'd pride
To come betwixt our sentence and our power,—
Which nor our nature nor our place can hear,—
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world;
And, on the sixth, to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
This shall not be revok'd.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<5%>
Fare thee well, king; sith thus thou wilt appear,
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Cordelia.>
</STAGE DIR> The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
<STAGE DIR>
<To Regan and Goneril.>
</STAGE DIR> And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes! bids you all adieu;
He'll shape his old course in a country new.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
</KENT>
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
</GLOUCESTER>
<LEAR>	<6%>
My Lord of Burgundy,
We first address toward you, who with this king
Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What, in the least,
Will you require in present dower with her,
Or cease your quest of love?
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>	<6%>
Most royal majesty,
I crave no more than hath your highness offer'd,
Nor will you tender less.
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>	<6%>
Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us we did hold her so,
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
If aught within that little-seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
She's there, and she is yours.
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>	<6%>
I know no answer.
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>	<6%>
Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
Take her, or leave her?
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>	<6%>
Pardon me, royal sir;
Election makes not up on such conditions.
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>	<6%>
Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth.—<STAGE DIR>
<To France.>
</STAGE DIR> For you, great king,
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate; therefore, beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
Almost to acknowledge hers.
</LEAR>
<FRANCE>	<7%>
This is most strange,
That she, who even but now was your best object,
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
Fall into taint; which to believe of her,
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Could never plant in me.
</FRANCE>
<CORDELIA>	<7%>
I yet beseech your majesty—
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
I'll do 't before I speak—that you make known
It is no vicious blot nor other foulness,
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour,
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
That I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<7%>
Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleas'd me better.
</LEAR>
<FRANCE>	<7%>
Is it but this? a tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
What say you to the lady? Love is not love
When it is mingled with regards that stand
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
She is herself a dowry.
</FRANCE>
<BURGANDY>	<7%>
Royal Lear,
Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy.
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>	<7%>
Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>	<8%>
I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband.
</BURGANDY>
<CORDELIA>	<8%>
Peace be with Burgundy!
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
I shall not be his wife.
</CORDELIA>
<FRANCE>	<8%>
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Shall buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
Thou losest here, a better where to find.
</FRANCE>
<LEAR>	<8%>
Thou hast her, France; let her be thine, for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again, therefore be gone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.
</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FRANCE>	<8%>
Bid farewell to your sisters.
</FRANCE>
<CORDELIA>	<8%>
The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father:
To your professed bosoms I commit him:
But yet, alas! stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So farewell to you both.
</CORDELIA>
<REGAN>	<8%>
Prescribe not us our duties.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<8%>
Let your study
Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you
At fortune's alms; you have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
</GONERIL>
<CORDELIA>	<9%>
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides;
Who covers faults, at last shame them derides.
Well may you prosper!
</CORDELIA>
<FRANCE>	<9%>
Come, my fair Cordelia.
</FRANCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit France and Cordelia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GONERIL>	<9%>
Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<9%>
That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<9%>
You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our sister most; and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<9%>
'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<9%>
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then, must we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed condition, but, therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<9%>
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<9%>
There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you, let us hit together: if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<9%>
We shall further think on't.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<9%>
We must do something, and i' the heat.
</GONERIL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
</SCENE 1>
<SCENE 2>
<A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester's Castle.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Edmund, with a letter.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<9%>
Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate. Fine word, 'legitimate!'
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate:—I grow, I prosper;
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
Kent banished thus! And France in choler parted!
And the king gone to-night! subscrib'd his power!
Confin'd to exhibition! All this done
Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<10%>
So please your lordship, none.
</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Putting up the letter.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<10%>
I know no news, my lord.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
What paper were you reading?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<10%>
Nothing, my lord.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let's see; come; if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<10%>
I beseech you, sir, pardon me; it is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read, and for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'er-looking.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
Give me the letter, sir.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
Let's see, let's see.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, <EDGAR.—HUM! CONSPIRACY! 'SLEEP TILL I WAKED HIM, YOU...>
</GLOUCESTER>
<... SHOULD ENJOY HALF HIS REVENUE.'—MY SON EDGAR!...>
<... HAD HE A HAND TO WRITE THIS? A HEART AND BRAIN...>
<... TO BREED IT IN? WHEN CAME THIS TO YOU? WHO BROUGHT IT?>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
It was not brought me, my lord; there's the cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
You know the character to be your brother's?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but, in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
It is his.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
Never, my lord: but I have often heard him maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<12%>
I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
Think you so?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<12%>
If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and that without any further delay than this very evening.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
He cannot be such a monster—
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<12%>
Nor is not, sure.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
—to his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you: frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<12%>
I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked between son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing: do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! 'Tis strange!
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<13%>
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune,—often the surfeit of our own behaviour,—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. 'Sfoot! I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar—
</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>
and pat he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.
<EDGAR>	<14%>
How now, brother Edmund! What serious contemplation are you in?
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>
Do you busy yourself with that?
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
I promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state; menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
Come, come; when saw you my father last?
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>
The night gone by.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
Spake you with him?
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>

</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>
None at all.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>
Some villain hath done me wrong.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower, and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray you, go; there's my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<14%>
Armed, brother!
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<14%>
Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed; I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you; I have told you what I have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it; pray you, away.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<15%>
Shall I hear from you anon?
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<15%>
I do serve you in this business.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>
A credulous father, and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy! I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

<GONERIL>	<15%>
Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
</GONERIL>
<OSWALD>	<15%>
Ay, madam.
</OSWALD>
<GONERIL>	<15%>
By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other,
That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
If you come slack of former services,
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
</GONERIL>
<OSWALD>	<15%>
He's coming, madam; I hear him.
</OSWALD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Horns within.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GONERIL>	<15%>
Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellows; I'd have it come to question:
If he distaste it, let him to my sister,
Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
Not to be over-rul'd. Idle old man,
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd
With cheeks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.
Remember what I have said.
</GONERIL>
<OSWALD>	<16%>
Well, madam.
</OSWALD>
<GONERIL>	<16%>
And let his knights have colder looks among you;
What grown of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister
To hold my very source. Prepare for dinner.

If but as well I other accents borrow,
That can my speech diffuse, my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,
Shall find thee full of labours.

<Exit an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR> How now! what art thou?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<16%>
A man, sir.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<16%>
What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<16%>
I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse with him that is wise, and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<16%>
What art thou?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<16%>
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<16%>
If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<16%>

</KENT>
<LEAR>	<16%>
Whom wouldst thou serve?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<16%>
You.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<16%>
Dost thou know me, fellow?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<17%>
No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<17%>
What's that?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<17%>
Authority.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<17%>
What services canst thou do?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<17%>
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly; that which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<17%>
How old art thou?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<17%>
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for any thing; I have years on my back forty-eight.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<17%>
Follow me; thou shalt serve me; if I like thee no worse after dinner I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho! dinner! Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.

</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Knight.>
</STAGE DIR>
<KNIGHT>	<17%>
He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
</KNIGHT>
<LEAR>	<17%>
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?
</LEAR>
<KNIGHT>	<17%>
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.
</KNIGHT>
<LEAR>	<17%>
He would not!
</LEAR>
<KNIGHT>	<17%>
My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my judgment, your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and your daughter.
</KNIGHT>
<LEAR>	<18%>
Ha! sayest thou so?
</LEAR>
<KNIGHT>	<18%>
I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.
</KNIGHT>
<LEAR>	<18%>
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness: I will look further into 't. But where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.
</LEAR>
<KNIGHT>	<18%>
Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined him away.
</KNIGHT>
<LEAR>	<18%>
No more of that; I have noted it well.
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.
<STAGE DIR>

My lady's father.

<LEAR>	<18%>
'My lady's father!' my lord's knave: you whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
</LEAR>
<OSWALD>	<18%>
I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.

<LEAR>	<18%>
Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<19%>
Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
</FOOL>
<KENT>	<19%>
Why, fool?
</KENT>
<FOOL>	<19%>
Why? for taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow has banished two on 's daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will: if thou follow him thou must needs wear my coxcomb. How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<19%>
Why, my boy?
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<19%>
If I gave them all my living, I'd keep my coxcombs myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<19%>
Take heed, sirrah; the whip.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<19%>
Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<19%>
A pestilent gall to me!
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<19%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Kent.>
</STAGE DIR> Sirrah, I'll teach' thee a speech.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<19%>
Do.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<19%>
Mark it, nuncle:—
Have more than thou showest,
Speak less than thou knowest,
Lend less than thou owest,
Ride more than thou goest,
Learn more than thou trowest,
Set less than thou throwest;
Leave thy drink and thy whore,
And keep in-a-door,
And thou shalt have more
Than two tens to a score.
</FOOL>
<KENT>	<19%>
This is nothing, fool.
</KENT>
<FOOL>	<19%>
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer, you gave me nothing for 't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<20%>
Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<20%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Kent.>
</STAGE DIR> Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<20%>
A bitter fool!
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<20%>
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<20%>
No, lad; teach me.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<20%>
That lord that counsell'd thee
To give away thy land,
Come place him here by me,
Do thou for him stand:
The sweet and bitter fool
Will presently appear;
The one in motley here,
The other found out there.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<20%>
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<20%>
All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with.
</FOOL>
<KENT>	<20%>
This is not altogether fool, my lord.
</KENT>
<FOOL>	<20%>
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if I had a monopoly out, they would have part on 't, and ladies too: they will not let me have all fool to myself; they'll be snatching. Nuncle, give me an egg, and I'll give thee two crowns.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<20%>
What two crowns shall they be?
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<20%>
Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away both parts, thou borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.
Fools had ne'er less grace in a year;
For wise men are grown foppish,
And know not how their wits to wear,
Their manners are so apish.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<20%>
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<21%>
I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers; for when thou gavest them the rod and puttest down thine own breeches,
Then they for sudden joy did weep,
And I for sorrow sung,
That such a king should play bo-peep,
And go the fools among.
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<21%>
An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<21%>
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool; and yet I would not be thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides, and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o' the parings.
</FOOL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Goneril.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEAR>	<21%>
How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<21%>
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now; I am a fool, thou art nothing. <STAGE DIR>
<To Goneril.>
</STAGE DIR> Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face bids me, though you say nothing.
Mum, mum;
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,
Weary of all, shall want some.
That's a shealed peascod.
</FOOL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Pointing to Lear.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GONERIL>	<21%>
Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
That you protect this course, and put it on
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
Might in their working do you that offence,
Which else were shame, that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding.
</GONERIL>
<FOOL>	<22%>
For you trow, nuncle,
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
That it had it head bit off by it young.
So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<22%>
Are you our daughter?
</LEAR>
<GONERIL>	<22%>
I would you would make use of your good wisdom,
Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
These dispositions which of late transform you
From what you rightly are.
</GONERIL>
<FOOL>	<22%>
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<22%>
Does any here know me? This is not Lear:
Does Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied. Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<22%>
Lear's shadow.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<22%>
I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
</LEAR>
<FOOL>	<22%>
Which they will make an obedient father.
</FOOL>
<LEAR>	<22%>
Your name, fair gentlewoman?
</LEAR>
<GONERIL>	<22%>
This admiration, sir, is much o' the favour
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright:
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold,
That this our court, infected with their manners,
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy; be then desir'd
By her that else will take the thing she begs,
A little to disquantity your train;
And the remainder, that shall still depend,
To be such men as may besort your age,
Which know themselves and you.
</GONERIL>
<LEAR>	<23%>
Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses; call my train together.
Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:
Yet have I left a daughter.

You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble
Make servants of their betters.

And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name. O most small fault,
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
From the fix'd place, drew from my heart all love,
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,

My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Of what hath mov'd you.
</ALBANY>
<LEAR>	<24%>
It may be so, my lord.
Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful!
Into her womb convey sterility!
Dry up in her the organs of increase,
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
Create her child of spleen, that it may live
And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her!
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child! Away, away!

</STAGE DIR> Life and death! I am asham'd
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
Let it be so: I have another daughter,
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.

Well, you may fear too far.

<Enter Edmund and Curan, meeting.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<27%>
Save thee, Curan.
</EDMUND>
<CURAN>	<27%>
And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him to-night.
</CURAN>
<EDMUND>	<27%>
How comes that?
</EDMUND>
<CURAN>	<27%>
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad? I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?
</CURAN>
<EDMUND>	<27%>
Not I: pray you, what are they?
</EDMUND>
<CURAN>	<27%>
Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
</CURAN>
<EDMUND>	<28%>
Not a word.
</EDMUND>
<CURAN>	<28%>
You may do then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
</CURAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<28%>
The duke be here to-night! The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>
My father watches: O sir! fly this place;
Intelligence is given where you are hid;
You have now the good advantage of the night.
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither, now, i' the night, i' the haste,
And Regan with him; have you nothing said
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
</EDMUND>
Advise yourself.
<EDGAR>	<28%>
I am sure on 't, not a word.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<28%>
I hear my father coming; pardon me;
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you;
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now 'quit you well.
Yield;—come before my father. Light, ho! here!
Fly, brother. Torches! torches! So, farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
<STAGE DIR>
<Wounds his arm.>

Do more than this in sport. Father! father!
Stop, stop! No help?
</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<28%>
Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<28%>
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<28%>
But where is he?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<28%>
Look, sir, I bleed.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<29%>
Where is the villain, Edmund?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<29%>
Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could—
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<29%>
Pursue him, ho! Go after. <STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt some Servants.>
</STAGE DIR> 'By no means' what?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<29%>
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But that I told him, the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body, lanc'd mine arm:
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits
Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to the encounter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<29%>
Let him fly far:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found—dispatch. The noble duke my master,
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
By his authority I will proclaim it,
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
He that conceals him, death.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<29%>
When I dissuaded him from his intent,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth, in thee
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,—
As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
My very character,—I'd turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
Strong and fasten'd villain!
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Tucket within.>
</STAGE DIR>
Hark! the duke's trumpets. I know not why he comes.
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
May have due note of him; and of my land,
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
To make thee capable.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>

How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,—

If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?
</REGAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
O! madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd.
</GLOUCESTER>
<REGAN>	<30%>
What! did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father nam'd? your Edgar?
</REGAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
O! lady, lady, shame would have it hid.
</GLOUCESTER>
<REGAN>	<30%>
Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?
</REGAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
I know not, madam; 'tis too bad, too bad.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>	<30%>
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
</EDMUND>
<REGAN>	<30%>
No marvel then though he were ill affected;
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well-inform'd of them, and with such cautions
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there.
</REGAN>
<CORNWALL>	<30%>
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
A child-like office.
</CORNWALL>
<EDMUND>	<30%>
'Twas my duty, sir.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
He did bewray his practice; and receiv'd
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
</GLOUCESTER>
<CORNWALL>	<31%>
Is he pursu'd?
</CORNWALL>
<GLOUCESTER>	<31%>
Ay, my good lord.
</GLOUCESTER>
<CORNWALL>	<31%>
If he be taken he shall never more
Be fear'd of doing harm; make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
You we first seize on.
</CORNWALL>
<EDMUND>	<31%>
I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>	<31%>
For him I thank your Grace.
</GLOUCESTER>
<CORNWALL>	<31%>
You know not why we came to visit you,—
</CORNWALL>
<REGAN>	<31%>
Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night:
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some prize,
Wherein we must have use of your advice.
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I best thought it fit
To answer from our home; the several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
Your needful counsel to our businesses,
Which craves the instant use.

I love thee not.

Fellow, I know thee.
</KENT>
<OSWALD>	<32%>
What dost thou know me for?
</OSWALD>
<KENT>	<32%>
A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking knave; a whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition.
</KENT>
<OSWALD>	<32%>
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
</OSWALD>
<KENT>	<32%>
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king? Draw, you rogue; for, though it be night, yet the moon shines: I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you. <STAGE DIR>

<OSWALD>	<33%>
I am scarce in breath, my lord.
</OSWALD>
<KENT>	<33%>
No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a tailor made thee.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<33%>
Thou art a strange fellow; a tailor make a man?
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<33%>
Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though they had been but two hours o' the trade.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<33%>
Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
</CORNWALL>
<OSWALD>	<33%>
This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd at suit of his grey beard,—
</OSWALD>
<KENT>	<33%>
Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of a jakes with him. Spare my grey beard, you wagtail?
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<33%>
Peace, sirrah!
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<33%>
Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<33%>
Why art thou angry?
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<33%>
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters,
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<34%>
What! art thou mad, old fellow?
</CORNWALL>
<GLOUCESTER>	<34%>
How fell you out? say that.
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>	<34%>
No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<34%>
Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<34%>
His countenance likes me not.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<34%>
No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<34%>
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<34%>
This is some fellow,
Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth:
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty silly-ducking observants,
That stretch their duties nicely.
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<34%>
Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
Under the allowance of your grand aspect,
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phœbus' front,—
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<34%>
What mean'st by this?
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<34%>
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to 't.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<34%>
What was the offence you gave him?
</CORNWALL>
<OSWALD>	<35%>
I never gave him any:
It pleas'd the king his master very late
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,
Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
And put upon him such a deal of man,
That worthied him, got praises of the king
For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
Drew on me here again.
</OSWALD>
<KENT>	<35%>
None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<35%>
Fetch forth the stocks!
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
We'll teach you.
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>	<35%>
Sir, I am too old to learn,
Call not your stocks for me; I serve the king,
On whose employment I was sent to you;
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master,
Stocking his messenger.
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>	<35%>
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
There shall he sit till noon.
</CORNWALL>
<REGAN>	<35%>
Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too.
</REGAN>
<KENT>	<35%>
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
You should not use me so.
</KENT>
<REGAN>	<35%>
Sir, being his knave, I will.
</REGAN>
<CORNWALL>	<35%>
This is a fellow of the self-same colour
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks.
</CORNWALL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Stocks brought out.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<35%>
Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
His fault is much, and the good king his master
Will check him for't: your purpos'd low correction
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
That he, so slightly valu'd in his messenger,
Should have him thus restrain'd.
</GLOUCESTER>
<CORNWALL>	<36%>
I'll answer that.

Pray, do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard;
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:

Good king, that must approve the common saw,
Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st

That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
Of my obscured course; and shall find time
From this enormous state, seeking to give
Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
This shameful lodging.

I heard myself proclaim'd;
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escap'd the hunt. No port is free; no place,
That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
Does not attend my taking. While I may 'scape
I will preserve myself; and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury, in contempt of man,
Brought near to beast; my face I'll grime with filth,
Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,
And with presented nakedness outface
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who with roaring voices,
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygood! poor Tom!
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

My lord, when at their home

Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
My duty kneeling, there came a reeking post,
Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
Which presently they read: on whose contents
They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
Commanded me to follow, and attend
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
And meeting here the other messenger,
Whose welcome, I perceiv'd, had poison'd mine,—
Being the very fellow which of late
Display'd so saucily against your highness,—
Having more man than wit about me,—drew:
He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.

Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it; but the great one that goes up the hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
And follows but for form,
Will pack when it begins to rain,
And leave thee in the storm.
But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
And let the wise man fly:
The knave turns fool that runs away;
The fool no knave, perdy.

My dear lord,
You know the fiery quality of the duke;
How unremovable and fix'd he is
In his own course.
</GLOUCESTER>
<LEAR>	<40%>
Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
Fiery! what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
</LEAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<40%>
Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
</GLOUCESTER>

Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?
</LEAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<40%>
Ay, my good lord.
</GLOUCESTER>
<LEAR>	<40%>
The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
Fiery! the fiery duke! Tell the hot duke that—
No, but not yet; may be he is not well:
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;
And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
For the sound man. Death on my state! <STAGE DIR>
<Looking on Kent.>
</STAGE DIR> Wherefore
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
That this remotion of the duke and her
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
Go, tell the duke and's wife I'd speak with them,
Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.

Sepulchring an adult'ress.—<STAGE DIR>

I cannot think my sister in the least

O, sir! you are old;
Nature in you stands on the very verge

Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return;
Say, you have wrong'd her, sir.

She hath abated me of half my train;
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.

On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!
</LEAR>
<CORNWALL>	<42%>
Fie, air, fie!

<REGAN>	<42%>
O the blest gods! So will you wish on me,
When the rash mood is on.
</REGAN>
<LEAR>	<42%>
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce, but thine
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
Wherein I thee endow'd.

O sides! you are too tough;

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
If, till the expiration of your month,
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
I am now from home, and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

<LEAR>	<43%>
Return to her? and fifty men dismiss'd!
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
To wage against the enmity o' the air;
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her!
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
To keep base life afoot. Return with her!
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom.

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
We'll no more meet, no more see one another;
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.
</LEAR>
<REGAN>	<44%>
Not altogether so:
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so—
But she knows what she does.
</REGAN>
<LEAR>	<44%>
Is this well spoken?
</LEAR>
<REGAN>	<44%>
I dare avouch it, sir: what! fifty followers?
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
Should many people, under two commands,
Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<44%>
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<44%>
Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack you
We could control them. If you will come to me,—
For now I spy a danger,—I entreat you
To bring but five-and-twenty; to no more
Will I give place or notice.
</REGAN>
<LEAR>	<44%>
I gave you all—
</LEAR>
<REGAN>	<44%>
And in good time you gave it
</REGAN>
<LEAR>	<44%>
Made you my guardians, my depositaries,
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
With such a number. What! must I come to you
With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?
</LEAR>
<REGAN>	<45%>
And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.
</REGAN>
<LEAR>	<45%>
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
When others are more wicked; not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise. <STAGE DIR>

Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
And thou art twice her love.

<GONERIL>	<45%>
Hear me, my lord.
What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
To follow in a house, where twice so many
Have a command to tend you?
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<45%>
What need one?
</REGAN>
<LEAR>	<45%>
O! reason not the need; our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,—
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
Against their father, fool me not so much
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both
That all the world shall—I will do such things,—
What they are yet I know not,—but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
No, I'll not weep:
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Or ere I'll weep. O fool! I shall go mad.

I know you. Where's the king?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<47%>
Contending with the fretful elements;
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
And bids what will take all.

But who is with him?

His heart-struck injuries.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<47%>
Sir, I do know you;
And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
Who have—as who have not, that their great stars
Thron'd and set high—servants, who seem no less,
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
In some of our best ports, and are at point
To show their open banner. Now to you:
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
Some that will thank you, making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
And from some knowledge and assurance offer
This office to you.
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<48%>
I will talk further with you.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<48%>
No, do not.
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,—
As doubt not but you shall,—show her this ring,
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
I will go seek the king.
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<48%>
Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
</GENTLEMAN>

When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of Albion

Go to; say you nothing. There is division between the dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet.

I will seek him and privily relieve him; go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the king, my old master, must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.

The body's delicate; the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to 't? But I will punish home:
No, I will weep no more. In such a night

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDGAR>	<65%>
Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace:
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester, led by an old Man.>
</STAGE DIR>
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
</EDGAR>
Life would not yield to age.
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
O my good lord!
I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,
These fourscore years.
</OLD MAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<66%>
Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone;
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
Thee they may hurt.
</GLOUCESTER>
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
You cannot see your way.
</OLD MAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<66%>
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen,
Our means secure us, and our mere defects
Prove our commodities. Ah! dear son Edgar.
The food of thy abused father's wrath;
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
I'd say I had eyes again.
</GLOUCESTER>
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
How now! Who's there?
</OLD MAN>
<EDGAR>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> O gods! Who is 't can say, 'I am at the worst?'
I am worse than e'er I was.
</EDGAR>
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
'Tis poor mad Tom.
</OLD MAN>
<EDGAR>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And worse I may be yet; the worst is not,
So long as we can say, 'This is the worst.'
</EDGAR>
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
Fellow, where goest?
</OLD MAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<66%>
Is it a beggar-man?
</GLOUCESTER>
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
Madman and beggar too.
</OLD MAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<66%>
He has some reason, else he could not beg.
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw,
Which made me think a man a worm: my son
Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard more since.
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods;
They kill us for their sport.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> How should this be?
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
Angering itself and others.—<STAGE DIR>
<To Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR> Bless thee, master!
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<66%>
Is that the naked fellow?
</GLOUCESTER>
<OLD MAN>	<66%>
Ay, my lord.
</OLD MAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<66%>
Then, prithee, get thee gone. If, for my sake,
Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
And bring some covering for this naked soul
Who I'll entreat to lead me.
</GLOUCESTER>
<OLD MAN>	<67%>
Alack, sir! he is mad.
</OLD MAN>
<GLOUCESTER>	<67%>
'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
Above the rest, be gone.
</GLOUCESTER>

I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
Come on 't what will.
</OLD MAN>
<STAGE DIR>

<EDGAR>	<67%>
Poor Tom's a-cold. <STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I cannot daub it further.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<67%>
Come hither, fellow.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<67%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And yet I must. Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<67%>
Know'st thou the way to Dover?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<67%>
Both stile and gate, horse-way and footpath. Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; and Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who since possesses chambermaids and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<67%>
Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
So distribution should undo excess,
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<67%>
Ay, master.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<67%>
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
Looks fearfully in the confined deep;
Bring me but to the very brim of it,
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear;
With something rich about me; from that place
I shall no leading need.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<68%>
Give me thy arm:
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

<Before the Duke of Albany's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Goneril and Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GONERIL>	<68%>
Welcome, my lord; I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way. <STAGE DIR>
<Enter Oswald.>
</STAGE DIR> Now, where's your master?
</GONERIL>
<OSWALD>	<68%>
Madam, within; but never man so chang'd.
I told him of the army that was landed;
He smil'd at it: I told him you were coming;
His answer was, 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
And of the loyal service of his son,
When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
What like, offensive.
</OSWALD>
<GONERIL>	<68%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR> Then, shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
That dares not undertake; he'll not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,
If you dare venture in your own behalf,
A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
<STAGE DIR>
<Giving a favour.>
</STAGE DIR>
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
Conceive, and fare thee well.

Yours in the ranks of death.
</EDMUND>
<GONERIL>	<69%>

O! the difference of man and man!

</STAGE DIR>
<GONERIL>	<69%>
I have been worth the whistle.
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<69%>
O Goneril!
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
That nature, which contemns its origin,
Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap, perforce must wither
And come to deadly use.
</ALBANY>
<GONERIL>	<69%>
No more; the text is foolish.
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<69%>
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
A father, and a gracious aged man,
Whose reverence the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
It will come,
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
Like monsters of the deep.
</ALBANY>
<GONERIL>	<69%>
Milk-liver'd man!
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats,
Whilst thou, a moral fool, sitt'st still, and criest
'Alack! why does he so?'
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
See thyself, devil!
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman.
</ALBANY>
<GONERIL>	<70%>
O vain fool!
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
Be-monster not thy feature. Were 't my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood,
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones; howe'er thou art a fiend,
A woman's shape doth shield thee.

<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
What news?
</ALBANY>
<MESSENGER>	<70%>
O! my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead;
Slain by his servant, going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester.
</MESSENGER>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
Gloucester's eyes!
</ALBANY>
<MESSENGER>	<70%>
A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
But not without that harmful stroke, which since
Hath pluck'd him after.
</MESSENGER>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
This shows you are above,
You justicers, that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
Lost he his other eye?
</ALBANY>
<MESSENGER>	<70%>
Both, both, my lord.
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
'Tis from your sister.
</MESSENGER>
<GONERIL>	<70%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> One way I like this well;
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life: another way,
This news is not so tart. <STAGE DIR>

No, my good lord; I met him back again.
</MESSENGER>
<ALBANY>	<71%>
Knows he the wickedness?

<MESSENGER>	<71%>
Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him,
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
Might have the freer course.

To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
Tell me what more thou knowest.

<SCENE 3>
<The French Camp, near Dover.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Kent and a Gentleman.>
</STAGE DIR>
<KENT>	<71%>
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger, that his personal return was most required and necessary.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<71%>
Who hath he left behind him general?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<71%>
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Her delicate cheek; it seem'd she was a queen
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
Sought to be king o'er her.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<71%>
O! then it mov'd her.
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
Were like a better way; those happy smilets
That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
If all could so become it.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
Made she no verbal question?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of 'father'
Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
Cried, 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
And clamour-moisten'd, then away she started
To deal with grief alone.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
It is the stars,
The stars above us, govern our conditions;
Else one self mate and make could not beget
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
No.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
Was this before the king return'd?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
No, since.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
Well, sir, the poor distress'd Lear's i' the town,
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
What we are come about, and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter.
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
Why, good sir?
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
To his dog-hearted daughters,—these things sting
His mind so venomously that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia.
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
Alack! poor gentleman.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
'Tis so, they are afoot.
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>	<72%>
Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
Along with me.

As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye.

The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,

All bless'd secrets,
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,

Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.

<OSWALD>	<74%>
Madam, with much ado:
Your sister is the better soldier.

<REGAN>	<74%>
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>	<74%>
No, madam.
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>	<74%>
What might import my sister's letter to him?
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>	<74%>
I know not, lady.
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>	<74%>
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
To let him live; where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life; moreover, to descry
The strength o' the enemy.
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>	<74%>
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>	<74%>
Our troops set forth to-morrow; stay with us,
The ways are dangerous.
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>	<74%>
I may not, madam;
My lady charg'd my duty in this business.
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>	<74%>
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
Something—I know not what. I'll love thee much,
Let me unseal the letter.
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>	<74%>
Madam, I had rather—
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>	<74%>
I know your lady does not love her husband;
I am sure of that: and at her late being here
She gave strange ceilliades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>	<74%>
I, madam!
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>	<74%>
I speak in understanding; you are, I know't:
Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady's. You may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you, give him this,
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her:
So, fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
</REGAN>

Would I could meet him, madam: I would show
What party I do follow.

You do climb up it now; look how we labour.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<75%>
Methinks the ground is even.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<75%>
Horrible steep:
Hark! do you hear the sea?
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<75%>
No, truly.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<75%>
Why, then you other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes' anguish.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<75%>
So may it be, indeed.
Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<75%>
Y'are much deceiv'd; in nothing am I chang'd
But in my garments.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<75%>
Methinks you're better spoken.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<75%>
Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still.
How fearful
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles; half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark
Diminish'd to her cock, her cock a buoy
Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<75%>
Set me where you stand.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<76%>
Give me your hand; you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<76%>
Let go my hand.
Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<76%>
Now fare you well, good sir.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<76%>
With all my heart.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<76%>
Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<76%>
O you mighty gods!
This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
Shake patiently my great affliction off;
If I could bear it longer, and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
Now, fellow, fare thee well.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<He falls forward.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDGAR>	<76%>
Gone, sir: farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life when life itself
Yields to the theft; had he been where he thought
By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?
<STAGE DIR>
<To Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR> Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir? speak!
Thus might he pass indeed; yet he revives.
What are you, sir?
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<76%>
Away and let me die.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<76%>
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating,
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe,
Hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<76%>
But have I fallen or no?
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<77%>
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorg'd lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<77%>
Alack! I have no eyes.
Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
And frustrate his proud will.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<77%>
Give me your arm:
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<77%>
Too well, too well.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<77%>
This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
Which parted from you?

<EDGAR>	<77%>
As I stood here below methought his eyes
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea:
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
Of men's impossibilities, have preserv'd thee.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<77%>
I do remember now; henceforth I'll bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of
I took it for a man; often 'twould say
'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.

Nature's above art in that respect. There's your press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look! a mouse. Peace, peace! this piece of toasted cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O! well flown, bird; i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh! Give the word.

Sweet marjoram.

</LEAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<78%>
I know that voice.
</GLOUCESTER>
<LEAR>	<78%>
Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatter'd me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are not men o' their words: they told me I was every thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
</LEAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<78%>
The trick of that voice I do well remember:
Is 't not the king?
</GLOUCESTER>
<LEAR>	<78%>
Ay, every inch a king:
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
Adultery?
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
To 't luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
Behold yond simpering dame,
Whose face between her forks presageth snow;
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure's name;
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to 't
With a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
Though women all above:
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
Beneath is all the fiends':
There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit,
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination: there's money for thee.

What! art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yound justice rails upon yon simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?

Ay, sir.

<LEAR>	<79%>
And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority; a dog's obey'd in office.
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw doth pierce it.
None does offend, none, I say none; I'll able 'em:
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
And, like a scurvy politician, seem
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now;
Pull off my boots; harder, harder; so.

Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many opportunities to cut him off; if your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he return the conqueror; then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour.

And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,

With this ungracious paper strike the sight

Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,

Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant

And hardly shall I carry out my side,
Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use
His countenance for the battle; which being done
Let her who would be rid of him devise

Away, old man! give me thy hand: away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
Give me thy hand; come on.
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<89%>
No further, sir; a man may rot even here.
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>	<89%>
What! in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence, even as their coming hither:
Ripeness is all. Come on.

And that's true too.

<The British Camp, near Dover.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, Edmund;...>
<... Lear and Cordelia, prisoners; Officers, Soldiers, &c.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<89%>
Some officers take them away: good guard,
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them.
</EDMUND>
<CORDELIA>	<89%>
We are not the first
Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
Myself could else out-frown false Fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>	<90%>
No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison;
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
And take upon's the mystery of things,
As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
In a wall'd prison, packs and sets of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon.
</LEAR>
<EDMUND>	<90%>
Take them away.
</EDMUND>
<LEAR>	<90%>
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
The goujeres shall devour them, flesh and fell,
Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.
Come.
</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<90%>
Come hither, captain; hark,
Take thou this note; <STAGE DIR>
<Giving a paper.>
</STAGE DIR> go follow them to prison:
One step I have advanc'd thee; if thou dost
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes; know thou this, that men
Are as the time is; to be tender-minded
Does not become a sword; thy great employment
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do't,
Or thrive by other means.
</EDMUND>
<OFFICER>	<90%>
I'll do't, my lord.
</OFFICER>
<EDMUND>	<91%>
About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
Mark,—I say, instantly, and carry it so
As I have set it down.
</EDMUND>

I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats;
If it be man's work I will do it.

<Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Officers, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALBANY>	<91%>
Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
And fortune led you well; you have the captives
Who were the opposites of this day's strife;
We do require them of you, so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine.
</ALBANY>
<EDMUND>	<91%>
Sir, I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention, and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed; the friend hath lost his friend,
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd
By those that feel their sharpness;
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<91%>
Sir, by your patience,
I hold you but a subject of this war,
Not as a brother.
</ALBANY>
<REGAN>	<91%>
That's as we list to grace him:
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
Bore the commission of my place and person;
The which immediacy may well stand up,
And call itself your brother.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<91%>
Not so hot;
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
More than in your addition.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<92%>
In my rights,
By me invested, he compeers the best.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<92%>
That were the most, if he should husband you.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<92%>
Jesters do oft prove prophets.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<92%>
Holla, holla!
That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>	<92%>
Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
From a full-flowing stomach. General,
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine;
Witness the world, that I create thee here
My lord and master.
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<92%>
Mean you to enjoy him?
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
The let-alone lies not in your good will.
</ALBANY>
<EDMUND>	<92%>
Nor in thine, lord.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
Half-blooded fellow, yes.
</ALBANY>
<REGAN>	<92%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR> Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
</REGAN>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
On capital treason; and, in thy arrest,
This gilded serpent. <STAGE DIR>
<Pointing to Goneril.>
</STAGE DIR> For your claim, fair sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife;
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
If you will marry, make your love to me,
My lady is bespoke.
</ALBANY>
<GONERIL>	<92%>
An interlude!
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
Thou art arm'd, Gloucester; let the trumpet sound:
If none appear to prove upon thy person
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
There is my pledge; <STAGE DIR>
<Throws down a glove.>
</STAGE DIR> I'll prove it on thy heart,
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
</ALBANY>
<REGAN>	<92%>
Sick! O sick!
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>	<92%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
</GONERIL>
<EDMUND>	<92%>
There's my exchange: <STAGE DIR>
<Throws down a glove.>
</STAGE DIR> what in the world he is
That names me traitor, villain-like be lies.
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
A herald, ho!
</ALBANY>
<EDMUND>	<93%>
A herald, ho! a herald!
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
All levied in my name, have in my name
Took their discharge.
</ALBANY>
<REGAN>	<93%>
My sickness grows upon me.
</REGAN>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
She is not well; convey her to my tent.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Regan, led.>
</STAGE DIR>
Come hither, herald,
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Herald.>
</STAGE DIR>
Let the trumpet sound,—
</ALBANY>
And read out this.
<OFFICER>	<93%>
Sound, trumpet!
</OFFICER>
<STAGE DIR>
<A trumpet sounds.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HERALD>	<93%>
If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear at the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.
</HERALD>
<EDMUND>	<93%>
Sound!

<STAGE DIR>
<First Trumpet.>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Edgar, armed, with a Trumpet before him.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Upon this call o' the trumpet.
</ALBANY>
<HERALD>	<93%>
What are you?
Your name? your quality? and why you answer
This present summons?
</HERALD>
<EDGAR>	<93%>
Know, my name is lost;
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.
</EDGAR>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
Which is that adversary?
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<93%>
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<94%>
Himself: what sayst thou to him?
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<94%>
Draw thy sword,
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
Thy arm may do thee justice; here is mine:
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
My oath, and my profession: I protest,
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor,
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,
Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince,
And, from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust below thy foot,
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Thou liest.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<94%>
In wisdom I should ask thy name;
But since thy outside looks so fair and war-like,
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn;
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart,
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALBANY>	<94%>
Save him, save him!
</ALBANY>
<GONERIL>	<94%>
This is practice, Gloucester:
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
But cozen'd and beguil'd.
</GONERIL>
<ALBANY>	<94%>
Shut your mouth, dame,
Or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.
</ALBANY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Gives the letter to Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GONERIL>	<95%>
Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
Who can arraign me for 't?
</GONERIL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
Most monstrous!
Know'st thou this paper?
</ALBANY>
<EDMUND>	<95%>
Ask me not what I know.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
</ALBANY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit an Officer.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<95%>
What you have charg'd me with, that have I done,
And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
I do forgive thee.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<95%>
Let's exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<95%>
Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father.
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<95%>
Worthy prince, I know 't.
</EDGAR>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<95%>
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
And, when 'tis told, O! that my heart would burst,
The bloody proclamation to escape
That follow'd me so near,—O! our lives' sweetness,
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!—taught me to shift
Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
Never,—O fault!—reveal'd myself unto him,
Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd;
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,—
Alack! too weak the conflict to support;
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Burst smilingly.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<96%>
This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;
You look as you had something more to say.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<96%>
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Hearing of this.
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<96%>
This would have seem'd a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
To amplify too much, would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there a man,
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out
As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting
His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpet sounded,
And there I left him tranc'd.
</EDGAR>
<ALBANY>	<96%>
But who was this?
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<96%>
Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
Improper for a slave.
</EDGAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GENTLEMAN>	<96%>
Help, help! O help!
</GENTLEMAN>
<EDGAR>	<96%>
What kind of help?
</EDGAR>
<ALBANY>	<96%>
Speak, man.
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<97%>
What means that bloody knife?
</EDGAR>
<GENTLEMAN>	<97%>
'Tis hot, it smokes;
It came even from the heart of—O! she's dead.
</GENTLEMAN>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
Who dead? speak, man.
</ALBANY>
<GENTLEMAN>	<97%>
Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
By her is poison'd; she confesses it.
</GENTLEMAN>
<EDMUND>	<97%>
I was contracted to them both: all three
Now marry in an instant.
</EDMUND>
<EDGAR>	<97%>
Here comes Kent.
</EDGAR>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead:
This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
Touches us not with pity.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Gentleman.>
</STAGE DIR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Kent.>
</STAGE DIR>
O! is this he?
The time will not allow the compliment
</ALBANY>
Which very manners urges.
<KENT>	<97%>
I am come
To bid my king and master aye good-night;
Is he not here?
</KENT>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
Great thing of us forgot!
Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
Seest thou this object, Kent?
</ALBANY>
<STAGE DIR>
<The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.>
</STAGE DIR>
<KENT>	<97%>
Alack! why thus?
</KENT>
<EDMUND>	<97%>
Yet Edmund was belov'd:
The one the other poison'd for my sake,
And after slew herself.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
Even so. Cover their faces.
</ALBANY>
<EDMUND>	<97%>
I pant for life: some good I mean to do
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
Nay, send in time.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
Run, run! O run!
</ALBANY>
<EDGAR>	<97%>
To whom, my lord? Who has the office? send
Thy token of reprieve.
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>	<97%>
Well thought on: take my sword,
Give it the captain.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
Haste thee, for thy life.
</ALBANY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<97%>
He hath commission from my wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
That she fordid herself.
</EDMUND>
<ALBANY>	<98%>
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
<STAGE DIR>
<Edmund is borne off.>
</STAGE DIR>
</ALBANY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lear, with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Officer, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEAR>	<98%>
Howl, howl, howl, howl! O! you are men of stones:
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so
That heaven's vaults should crack. She's gone for ever.
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Why, then she lives.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<98%>
Is this the promis'd end?
</KENT>
<EDGAR>	<98%>
Or image of that horror?
</EDGAR>
<ALBANY>	<98%>
Fall and cease?
</ALBANY>
<LEAR>	<98%>
This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<98%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kneeling.>
</STAGE DIR> O, my good master!
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<98%>
Prithee, away.
</LEAR>
<EDGAR>	<98%>
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
</EDGAR>
<LEAR>	<98%>
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have sav'd her; now, she's gone for ever!
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
What is 't thou sayst? Her voice was ever soft,
Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.
I kill'd the slave that was a hanging thee.
</LEAR>
<OFFICER>	<98%>
'Tis true, my lord, he did.
</OFFICER>
<LEAR>	<98%>
Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip: I am old now,
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<98%>
If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,
One of them we behold.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<98%>
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<99%>
The same,
Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<99%>
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<99%>
No, my good lord; I am the very man—
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<99%>
I'll see that straight.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<99%>
That, from your first of difference and decay,
Have follow'd your sad steps.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<99%>
You are welcome hither.
</LEAR>
<KENT>	<99%>
Nor no man else; all's cheerless, dark, and deadly:
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
And desperately are dead.
</KENT>
<LEAR>	<99%>
Ay, so I think.
</LEAR>

He knows not what he says, and vain it is

Very bootless.

<Enter an Officer.>

<OFFICER>	<99%>
Edmund is dead, my lord.

<ALBANY>	<99%>
That's but a trifle here.
You lords and noble friends, know our intent;
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,
During the life of this old majesty,
To him our absolute power:—<STAGE DIR>
<To Edgar and Kent.>
</STAGE DIR> You, to your rights;
With boot and such addition as your honours
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue, and all foes
The cup of their deservings. O! see, see!
</ALBANY>
<LEAR>	<99%>
And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
Never, never, never, never, never!
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
Look there, look there!

Break, heart; I prithee, break.

<EDGAR>	<100%>
Look up, my lord.
</EDGAR>
<KENT>	<100%>
Vex not his ghost: O! let him pass; he hates him
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer.
</KENT>
<EDGAR>	<100%>
He is gone, indeed.
</EDGAR>
<KENT>	<100%>
The wonder is he hath endur'd so long:
He but usurp'd his life.
</KENT>
<ALBANY>	<100%>
Bear them from hence. Our present business
Is general woe. <STAGE DIR>
<To Kent and Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR> Friends of my soul, you twain
Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
</ALBANY>
<KENT>	<100%>
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
My master calls me, I must not say no.
</KENT>
<ALBANY>	<100%>
The weight of this sad time we must obey;
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
