He parts Himself -- like Leaves --
And then -- He closes up --
Then stands upon the Bonnet
Of Any Buttercup
And then He runs against
And oversets a Rose --
And then does Nothing --
Then away upon a Jib -- He goes --
And dangles like a Mote
Suspended in the Noon --
Uncertain -- to return Below --
Or settle in the Moon --
What come of Him -- at Night --
The privilege to say
Be limited by Ignorance --
What come of Him -- That Day
The Frost -- possess the World --
In Cabinets -- be shown --
A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss --
An Abbey -- a Cocoon --
