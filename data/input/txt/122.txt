Heart, not so heavy as mine
Wending late home -
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune -
A careless snatch - a ballad -
A ditty of the street -
Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet -
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled -
Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Opon a dusty way -
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why!
Tomorrow, night will come again -
Perhaps, weary and sore -
Ah Bugle! By my window
I pray you pass once more.
