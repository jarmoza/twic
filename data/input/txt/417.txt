The Love a Life can show Below
Is but a filament, I know,
Of that diviner thing
That faints opon the face of Noon -
And smites the Tinder in the Sun -
And hinders Gabriel's Wing -
'Tis this - in Music - hints and sways -
And far abroad on Summer days -
uncertain pain -
'Tis this enamors in the East -
And tints the Transit in the West
With harrowing Iodine -
'Tis this - invites - appalls - endows -
Flits - glimmers - proves - dissolves -
Returns - suggests - convicts - enchants
Then - flings in Paradise -
