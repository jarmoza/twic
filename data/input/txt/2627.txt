To learn the Transport by the Pain --
As Blind Men -- learn the sun!
To die of thirst -- suspecting
That Brooks in Meadows run!
To stay the homesick -- homesick feet
Upon a foreign shore --
Haunted by native lands, the while --
And blue -- beloved air!
This is the Sovreign Anguish!
This -- the signal wo!
These are the patient "Laureates"
Whose voices -- trained -- below --
Ascend in ceaseless Carol --
Inaudible, indeed,
To us -- the duller scholars
Of the Mysterious Bard!
