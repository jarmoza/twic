If the foolish, call them -
Need the wiser,
If the Savans "Classify" them
It is just as well!
Those who read the "Revelations"
Must not criticize
Those who read the same Edition -
With beclouded Eyes!
Could we stand with that Old "Moses" -
"Canaan" denied -
Scan like him, the stately landscape
On the other side -
Doubtless, we should deem superfluous
Many Sciences,
Not pursued by learned Angels
In scholastic skies!
Low amid that glad Belles lettres
Grant that we may stand -
amid profound -
At that grand "Right hand"!
