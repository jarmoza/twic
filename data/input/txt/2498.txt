It did not surprise me --
So I said -- or thought --
She will stir her pinions
And the nest forgot,
Traverse broader forests --
Build in gayer boughs,
Breathe in Ear more modern
God's old fashioned vows --
This was but a Birdling --
What and if it be One within my bosom
Had departed me?
This was but a story --
What and if indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart instead?
