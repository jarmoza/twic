The Way I read a Letter's -- this --
'Tis first -- I lock the Door --
And push it with my fingers -- next --
For transport it be sure --
And then I go the furthest off
To counteract a knock --
Then draw my little Letter forth
And  slowly pick the lock --
Then -- glancing narrow, at the Wall --
And narrow at the floor
For firm Conviction of a Mouse
Not exorcised before --
Peruse how infinite I am
To no one that You -- know --
And sigh for lack of Heaven --
but not The Heaven God bestow --
