To put this World down, like a Bundle -
And walk steady, away,
Requires Energy - possibly Agony -
'Tis the Scarlet way
Trodden with straight renunciation
By the Son of God -
Later, his faint Confederates
Justify the Road -
Flavors of that old Crucifixion -
Filaments of Bloom, Pontius Pilate sowed -
Strong Clusters, from Barabbas' Tomb -
Sacrament, Saints partook before us -
Patent, every drop,
With the Brand of the Gentile Drinker
Who indorsed the Cup -
