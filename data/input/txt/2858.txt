I had not minded -- Walls --
Were Universe -- one Rock --
And far I heard his silver
Call The other side the Block --
I'd tunnel -- till my Groove
Pushed sudden thro' to his --
Then my face take her Recompense --
The looking in his Eyes --
But 'tis a single Hair --
A filament -- a law --
A Cobweb -- wove in Adamant --
A Battlement -- of Straw --
A limit like the Vail
Unto the Lady's face --
But every Mesh -- a Citadel --
And Dragons -- in the Crease --
