The Soul's Superior instants
Occur to Her -- alone --
When friend -- and Earth's occasion
Have infinite withdrawn --
Or She -- Herself -- ascended
To too remote a Hight
For lower Recognition
Than Her Omnipotent --
This Mortal Abolition
Is seldom -- but as fair
As Apparition -- subject
To Autocratic Air --
Eternity's disclosure
To favorites -- a few --
Of the Colossal substance
Of Immortality
