"Morning" means "Milking" to the Farmer,
Dawn to the Apennines --
Dice to the Maid.
"Morning" means just Chance to the Lover --
Just Revelation to the Beloved.
Epicures date a breakfast by it!
Heroes a battle,
The Miller a flood,
Faint-going eyes their lapse
From sighing,
Faith, the Experiment of our Lord!
