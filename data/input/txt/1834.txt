Escape is such a thankful Word
I often in the Night
Consider it unto myself
No spectacle in sight
Escape - it is the Basket
In which the Heart is caught
When down some awful Battlement
The rest of Life is dropt -
'Tis not to sight the savior -
It is to be the saved -
And that is why I lay my Head
Opon this trusty word -
